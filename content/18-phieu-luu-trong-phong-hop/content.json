    "context": "**TÓM TẮT TINH TẾ:**\n\n**Chủ đề:**  \nCâu chuyện khéo léo khám phá các chủ đề về sự phản bội, danh tính và những mối quan hệ phức tạp của quyền lực trong cả lĩnh vực cá nhân lẫn nghề nghiệp. Nó phê phán những áp lực xã hội liên quan đến việc làm mẹ và sự nghiệp, làm nổi bật những kỳ vọng kép đặt lên vai phụ nữ. Nỗi xáo trộn cảm xúc từ sự không chung thủy trở nên rõ nét, thể hiện những khó khăn mà phụ nữ phải đối mặt trong việc khẳng định quyền tự chủ của mình giữa những chuẩn mực văn hóa. Câu chuyện đi sâu vào các hậu quả pháp lý và tình cảm của sự phản bội trong văn hóa Việt Nam, minh họa cách mà những trải nghiệm này hình thành sức bền và sự lựa chọn của phụ nữ. Các mối quan hệ quyền lực, đặc biệt là những thay đổi sau sự phản bội và kỳ vọng xã hội, là một ống kính quan trọng mà qua đó các nhân vật định hình thực tại của họ. Thêm vào đó, số phận đối lập của các nhân vật sau những lựa chọn của họ thể hiện các hệ quả của sự phản bội và cuộc theo đuổi quyền lực.\n\n**Cốt truyện:**  \nTống Nguyệt phát hiện chồng mình, Trình Khải, có mối quan hệ ngoài luồng với thực tập sinh Lý Nhi trong một cuộc họp công ty, dẫn đến sự nhục nhã sâu sắc cá nhân. Để đối phó, Tống Nguyệt xây dựng một kế hoạch \"ly hôn giả\" để bảo vệ tài sản của cô trong khi xác nhận sự không chung thủy của chồng. Khi Lý Nhi mang thai và sau đó tiết lộ đứa trẻ không phải là con của Trình Khải, điều này làm sâu sắc thêm cuộc đối đầu của Tống Nguyệt với sự phản bội khi cô chiến đấu giành quyền tự chủ trước áp lực xã hội. Khi căng thẳng gia tăng, Tống Nguyệt lợi dụng mong muốn ổn định của Trình Khải và dàn xếp để anh ta bị sa thải khỏi công ty, thể hiện sự nhạy bén của cô. Cuối cùng, chiến lược pháp lý và việc ghi chép chi tiết của cô trở thành yếu tố quyết định trong việc giành lại quyền lực của mình trong một môi trường do nam giới chiếm ưu thế. Trong khi đó, Lý Nhi phải đối mặt với hậu quả của những lựa chọn của mình, cuối cùng mất đi sự chấp nhận của xã hội, trong khi sự sụp đổ của Trình Khải khiến anh sống dưới cái bóng của những kỳ vọng từ gia đình. Ngược lại, Tống Nguyệt thành công trong sự nghiệp và giành được sự công nhận.\n\n**Nhân vật:**  \n- **Tống Nguyệt:** Một nhân vật chính kiên cường và chiến lược, đối phó với sự phản bội của chồng một cách điềm tĩnh, được thúc đẩy bởi sự tức giận và quyết tâm. Hành trình của cô phản ánh một sự phát triển phức tạp khi cô tìm kiếm quyền lực và định nghĩa bản thân trong một xã hội đầy kỳ vọng.\n- **Trình Khải:** Chồng của Tống Nguyệt, kẻ không chung thủy phơi bày những bất an và xu hướng vụ lợi của mình. Tính cách thao túng và cảm giác được quyền của anh ta nổi bật khi phải đối mặt với hậu quả của hành động.\n- **Lý Nhi:** Thực tập sinh đầy tham vọng, người có mối quan hệ làm rối tung cuộc sống của Tống Nguyệt. Ban đầu được mô tả bằng sự trẻ trung và tham vọng, nhưng sự dễ bị tổn thương của cô khi vật lộn với việc làm mẹ cuối cùng tiết lộ sự thay đổi của các mối quan hệ quyền lực khi Tống Nguyệt khẳng định quyền kiểm soát hoàn cảnh của mình.\n\n**Nét tinh tế:**  \nSự phát triển cảm xúc của Tống Nguyệt chuyển từ giận dữ đến một cuộc theo đuổi tính độc lập có toan tính, thể hiện một tâm lý thực dụng được hình thành từ kinh nghiệm nghề nghiệp của cô. Việc ghi chép cẩn thận và cách tiếp cận chiến lược của cô đối với cả sự phản bội và những thách thức pháp lý tạo điều kiện cho sự suy ngẫm sâu sắc về những yêu cầu xã hội và những hy sinh cá nhân, cuối cùng dẫn dắt cô đến việc giành lại quyền lực và định nghĩa bản thân. Câu chuyện làm nổi bật sự hiệu quả của Tống Nguyệt trong việc sử dụng chứng cứ pháp lý để giành lại quyền kiểm soát, đặc biệt trong bối cảnh mà những lựa chọn sai lầm của Trình Khải và sự soi mói của xã hội tạo ra. Ngược lại, số phận của Lý Nhi và Trình Khải nhấn mạnh những thực tế khó khăn từ những lựa chọn của họ và những hậu quả thường khó lường của sự phản bội.\n\n**Giọng văn của tác giả:**  \nTác giả sử dụng một giọng điệu sắc bén và sâu sắc để đưa ra những bình luận chỉ trích về động lực giới tính hiện đại. Qua những tình huống dí dỏm xoay quanh Tống Nguyệt và những phản ứng có tính toán của cô, câu chuyện nhấn mạnh những áp lực phức tạp liên quan đến vai trò giới, đặc biệt trong những môi trường làm việc nơi các cuộc khủng hoảng cá nhân va chạm với trách nhiệm nghề nghiệp.\n\n**Phong cách:**  \nPhong cách của câu chuyện rất trực tiếp và hấp dẫn, thu hút sự chú ý của độc giả vào cách tiếp cận thực dụng của Tống Nguyệt trong những khoảnh khắc hỗn loạn. Việc sử dụng đối thoại và tự suy ngẫm một cách cân bằng làm phong phú thêm chiều sâu cảm xúc, đắm chìm người đọc vào những khó khăn của cô trong khi làm sáng tỏ những khát vọng về sự độc lập và thành công. Những cuộc đối thoại sắc bén và gợi cảm khiến tình huống căng thẳng trong các tương tác giữa các nhân vật trở nên sống động, đặc biệt trong những cuộc đối đầu tiết lộ động lực sâu sắc hơn.\n\n**Các motif lặp lại:**  \nNhững motif nổi bật bao gồm sự căng thẳng giữa nghĩa vụ nghề nghiệp và cuộc sống cá nhân, bản chất đa chiều của sự phản bội, và biểu tượng của việc ghi chép như một công cụ để giành lại quyền lực. Việc Tống Nguyệt vẫn ghi chép cẩn thận phản ánh mong muốn kiểm soát giữa những hỗn loạn, trong khi các thách thức pháp lý mà cô phải đối mặt nhấn mạnh hành trình của cô hướng tới sự hồi phục. Câu chuyện làm nổi bật những hậu quả của việc công khai trong các cuộc khủng hoảng cá nhân, làm nền tảng cho sự phát triển và sức bền của Tống Nguyệt trước những kỳ vọng xã hội, đặc biệt về việc làm mẹ. Thêm vào đó, sự sa sút của Lý Nhi và những khó khăn của Trình Khải minh họa những con đường đối lập ảnh hưởng từ những lựa chọn cá nhân, cuối cùng tiết lộ những yếu tố này tác động đến danh tính và động lực quyền lực của họ.",
    "content": "Khi chồng tôi, Trình Hà, xuất hiện trước màn hình, cả phòng họp không ai lên\ntiếng.\n\nTin tức cuối cùng dừng lại ở: “Nhắn wechat cho cô ấy đi, xấu hổ quá.”\n\nHôm nay là cuộc họp định kỳ đầu tháng, tất cả nhân viên phòng Kinh doanh phải\ntham dự, 52 người chứng kiến cảnh tôi bị đội nón xanh qua màn hình.\n\n(Chú thích: đội nón xanh, thuật ngữ chỉ người bị phản bội, bị cắm sừng, chồng/vợ\nngười đó ngoại tình)\n\nTrình Hà và tôi kết hôn được 1 năm thì anh ta đã tham dự team building với bộ\nphận của tôi với tư cách người nhà mấy lần, mọi người ở đây đều biết anh ta là\nchồng tôi.\n\nTôi chưa bao giờ tưởng tượng cảnh tượng mất mặt như thế này trong đời, nhưng\nkinh nghiệm nhiều năm nơi công sở giúp tôi phản ứng nhạy bén, nhanh chóng bật\nmáy tính ghi hình.\n\nLàm việc lưu chứng cứ là phẩm chất cơ bản trong công việc của tôi.\n\nMàn hình bên này yên tĩnh, màn hình bên kia ý xuân dạt dào.\n\nTrình Hà ôm cổ Lý Như, cô thực tập sinh mới của bộ phận chúng tôi, anh gác cằm\nlên vai cô ta, gương mặt phóng đại ở gần camera.\n\nLý Như cười duyên cọ cọ mặt anh ta: “Ghét quá à, lát nữa giám đốc Tống còn lên\ntiếng đấy, anh đừng phá em.”\n\nTrình Hà không kiêng dè gì hôn cô ta: “Hôm nay em gọi anh đến còn không phải\nmuốn nghe giọng Tống Duy cho thêm phần kích thích sao?”\n\n“Vậy anh nói đi, em với giám đốc Tống ai tốt hơn?”\n\n“Tất nhiên là em, nếu không phải Tống Duy nắm giữ dự án Minh Trí thì liệu anh có\ncưới một bà già không?”\n\nLòng tôi lạnh băng, Trình Hà à Trình Hà, năm đó anh theo đuổi tôi, không hề nói\nghét bỏ tôi là một bà cô già. Huống hồ, tôi cũng chỉ lớn hơn Lý Như 2 tuổi.\n\nMấy năm nay Trình Hà vẫn luôn biểu hiện thật sự yêu tôi, lúc kết hôn cũng hứa\nhẹn, sau này anh ta là hậu thuẫn cho tôi, tôi yên tâm nỗ lực làm việc, anh ta\nphụ trách chăm sóc gia đình.\n\nMà hiện tại, cảnh tượng này dùng từ vả mặt không đủ để hình dung.\n\nHình ảnh tiếp theo càng thêm khó coi, di động tôi bắt đầu bị tin nhắn ập tới\nđiên cuồng.\n\n“Không được, tôi không thể chịu được nữa!”\n\n“Thật không biết xấu hổ, chị Tống, sa thải Lý Như đi.”\n\n“Vậy cũng hời cho cô ta quá.”\n\nCó người đầu tiên lên tiếng, mọi người bắt đầu như được giải trừ phong ấn, nói\nthỏa thích.\n\nTôi lạnh lùng gõ chữ: “Cuộc họp tiếp tục, xin lỗi vì việc riêng của tôi làm\nphiền mọi người, nhưng chúng ta đặt công việc lên hàng đầu.”\n\nMặc dù tôi rất tức giận nhưng vào thời điểm quan trọng của dự án, đừng nói đến\nviệc Trình Hà ngoại tình với thực tập sinh, cho dù bố Trình Hà công khai ngoại\ntình thì tôi cũng phải dẫn dắt mọi người cùng kéo tiến độ dự án đi lên.\n\nTôi không tắt micro của Lý Như, giữa những tiếng động khó nghe của hai người họ,\nchúng tôi bắt đầu lên tiếng một cách trật tự.\n\nTôi nghĩ ngày hôm nay đối với tất cả người tham dự là trải nghiệm suốt đời khó\nquên.\n\nMay là Trình Hà rất nhanh, họp chưa được nửa thì anh ta đã lặng lẽ dừng quân.\n\nKhi thành viên cuối cùng báo cáo, Lý Như vẫn còn léo nhéo với Trình Hà.\n\n“Anh Trình, mấy lần rồi anh không đeo bao, nếu em mang thai thì sao đây?”\n\nTrình Hà hôn Lý Như rõ kêu, vung tay lên: “Mang thai thì sinh, Tống Duy là kẻ\ncuồng công việc, không sinh cho anh một đứa con. Em sinh con trai thì sẽ là hạt\ngiống duy nhất của nhà họ Trình anh!”\n\n“Vậy bao giờ anh ly hôn với cô ta?”\n\n“Chờ dự án Minh Trí vào tay, anh sẽ ly hôn với cô ta. Tống Duy có tiền thật, anh\nở cùng cô ta lâu như thế, dù gì cũng phải kiếm chút phí tổn thất tuổi trẻ chứ.”\n\n“Cũng đúng, đến lúc đó em chuyển thành nhân viên chính thức, tốt nhất là đá Tống\nDuy khỏi Minh Trí. Em ghét cái vẻ cao ngạo của cô ta muốn c.h.ế.t.”\n\nNgười đang báo cáo tạm dừng, ho khan một tiếng: “Giám đốc Tống, tôi báo cáo xong\nrồi.”\n\nTôi mở micro, hắng giọng, không có bất kỳ cảm xúc nào: “Gần đây mọi người đều\nlàm việc rất tốt, vất vả rồi. Hôm nay đến đây thôi.”\n\nCuộc họp kết thúc, Lý Như còn ngạc nhiên: “Hôm nay kết thúc nhanh thế.”\n\nTôi cười lạnh, tất nhiên phải nhanh kết thúc, nếu không chờ hai người phát hiện\nkhông tắt camera thì chẳng phải cái gì cũng biết sao.\n\nSau khi lưu lại biên bản và video cuộc họp, tôi nói với mọi người trong bộ phận,\nkhông có mặt Lý Như.\n\n“Sự việc hôm nay mọi người không cần lo cho tôi, tôi sẽ giải quyết tốt việc gia\nđình, không làm chậm trễ tiến độ dự án. Tôi cũng mong mọi người giúp tôi giữ bí\n\n----------\n\nSắp xếp lại mọi thứ xong xuôi, tôi gọi video cho Trình Hà.\n\nPhải một lúc lâu sau anh ta mới nghe máy, vờ vịt: “Bà xã, anh bận làm việc nên\nkhông thấy điện thoại.”\n\nBận làm việc hay bận mặc quần áo?\n\nBên kia video, Trình Hà ngồi trên sô pha, rèm cửa bên cạnh hơi rung rinh.\n\nTôi giả vờ như không hay biết, cười nói: “Trình Hà, tấm rèm phía sau anh khá\nđẹp, đưa điện thoại gần sang cho em xem với.”\n\nSắc mặt Trình Hà căng thẳng, có thể nhận ra anh ta hoảng loạn.\n\nChậc, tôi lại lần nữa nghi ngờ chỉ số thông minh của chính mình, kỹ thuật diễn\nxuất vụng về như vậy mà hôm nay tôi mới nhận ra.\n\n“Rèm thì có gì đẹp.”\n\n“Anh cứ đưa qua cho em xem xem.”\n\nPhía sau sô pha không có nhiều chỗ trống, muốn tránh khỏi tầm mắt tôi thì phải\nquỳ xuống bò ra ngoài, một món quà đáp lễ nhỏ, không đáng kể.\n\nTrình Hà chậm chạp quay điện thoại, rèm cửa lại lung lay nhiều hơn.\n\n“Sao anh chậm chạp vậy, sau rèm có giấu người à?”\n\nMặt Trình Hà cứng đờ: “Nói bừa gì vậy, trong lòng anh chỉ có mình em.”\n\nTôi cong môi, nhìn Trình Hà đầy ẩn ý.\n\nHôm nay tôi không định vạch trần Trình Hà, chỉ muốn thử xem phản ứng của anh ta.\nCó vẻ anh ta chưa sẵn sàng để bị tôi vạch trần.\n\nTừ sau khi kết hôn, tôi và Trình Hà có nhiều tài sản nhưng phần lớn đến từ các\nkhoản đầu tư và thu nhập của tôi, Trình Hà chỉ là nhân viên bình thường. Nhà\ncũng là tài sản trước hôn nhân của tôi.\n\nTất nhiên tôi muốn ly hôn với anh ta, nhưng phải cân nhắc kỹ hơn, anh ta đừng mơ\nlấy một xu nào của tôi đi. Không chỉ có thế, tôi còn muốn anh ta trả lại gấp đôi\nnhững gì anh ta có được từ tôi.\n\nCúp video, tôi gọi điện thoại cho người bạn luật sư, hỏi cô ấy giải pháp tối ưu\nhiện giờ là gì.\n\nTrước khi cưới, vì chứng minh mình không tham tiền tài, Trình Hà cực kỳ biết\nđiều mà công chứng tài sản, không có tranh chấp về quyền sở hữu bất động sản và\ntài sản đứng tên tôi.\n\nNhưng tiền lương của tôi, thu nhập từ cổ phiếu và cổ tức của tôi đều là tài sản\nchung của hai vợ chồng, một đồng tôi cũng không muốn để Trình Hà được lợi.\n\nKhi Trình Hà và Lý Như đang anh anh em em, tôi xuống tay xử lý tài sản của mình.\n\nNhưng tôi chỉ chuyển tài sản của mình đi thôi thì chưa đủ, tôi phải bắt Trình Hà\ntrả giá vì phản bội tôi. Thật sự không thể chịu đựng sự kinh tởm này.\n\n“Đi công tác lâu vậy, có nhớ em không?”\n\nTrình Hà cười nói: “Cả tâm trí anh đều là em.”\n\nTôi mỉm cười nhìn anh ta: “Vậy sao, thế thì em vui thật đấy.”\n\nTối đó, Trình Hà bị tôi lấy cớ bận làm việc để ngủ bên phòng làm việc, anh ta\nkhông nghi ngờ. Dù sao trong lòng anh ta tôi là kẻ cuồng công việc, vì công việc\ncó thể làm bất cứ điều gì.\n\nNgày hôm sau, cả bộ phận đều mong chờ Lý Như đến công ty. Mọi người đi WC cũng\nphải vòng qua bàn Lý Như nhìn một cái. Nhìn đến mức Lý Như không hiểu ra sao,\nmột buổi sáng chải tóc 18 lần.\n\nKhông chỉ vậy, đồng nghiệp bên cạnh Lý Như bỗng dưng cực kỳ bận rộn, buổi trưa\nđi ăn chỉ còn lại mình cô ta, không ai đi cùng.\n\nCông việc cô ta phụ trách bỗng trở nên phức tạp, lộn xộn, trưởng nhóm cũng trở\nnên sắc bén, lạnh lùng hơn.\n\nỞ nơi làm việc, không ai sẵn lòng vì một thực tập sinh mà đắc tội tôi, huống chi\ncô ta lại còn là một kẻ thứ ba khiến mọi người khinh thường.\n\nChịu đựng tra tấn cả ngày, bị mắng 3 lần, Lý Như trốn ở góc cầu thang khóc lóc\nqua điện thoại.\n\nKhông có gì ngạc nhiên khi đối tượng để cô ta khóc lóc kể lể là chồng tôi.\n\n“Chắc chắn giám đốc Tống không vừa mắt với em, chị ta ghen ghét em trẻ tuổi xinh\nđẹp.”\n\nKhông biết đầu dây bên kia nói gì, Lý Như nín khóc, mỉm cười: “Dù gì em cũng còn\ntrẻ, sau này có rất nhiều cơ hội.”\n\nTôi ở sau cánh cửa chống cháy lặng yên cong môi, bằng khả năng copy paste còn\nmắc lỗi của cô ta thì có lẽ cả đời cũng không có cơ hội.\n\nTôi cất tiếng ho khan thật to, ý báo động cho cô ta biết sau cửa có người. Lý\nNhư lập tức hoảng hốt quay lại, nhìn tôi đứng sau cửa cười tủm tỉm.\n\nCô ta biến sắc, như thể vừa nuốt phải con ruồi, lắp bắp: “Giám… giám đốc Tống.”\n\nTôi liếc nhìn cô ta trịch thượng, nói không cảm xúc: “Trong thời gian cá nhân\nnên tôi không bình luận, nhưng tốt nhất đừng nói những chuyện thị phi về đồng\nnghiệp. Nếu cô có gì bất mãn với tôi, công ty có cơ chế khiếu nại hoàn chỉnh.\nTất nhiên tôi không trực tiếp phụ trách kết quả công việc của cô, nếu công việc\n\n----------\n\nĐêm đó sắc mặt Trình Hà không được đẹp cho lắm.\n\nAnh ta nhân lúc tôi đi rót nước, mặt mày nghiêm nghị nói với tôi: “Duy Duy, có\nchuyện này anh vốn không muốn nói với em, nhưng về công, anh là nhân viên công\nty; về tư, anh là chồng em. Anh suy nghĩ rất lâu, vẫn nên nói với em.”\n\nTôi ra vẻ nghiêm túc lắng nghe.\n\nTrình Hà ngồi đối diện tôi: “Gần đây đồng nghiệp đều phản ánh em rất mất kiên\nnhẫn với nhân viên dưới quyền, thái độ hà khắc. Duy Duy, việc này bất lợi với\nhình ảnh lãnh đạo của em.”\n\nTôi vội cầm ly uống nước để che giấu nụ cười giễu cợt nơi khóe miệng.\n\nHiển nhiên là Lý Như lại tìm anh ta khóc lóc.\n\nCũng thật là làm khó Trình Hà, vì để tôi nhẹ nhàng với tình nhân bé bỏng của\nmình mà anh ta phải bịa ra một đoạn lời nói dài dòng, đường hoàng thế để nói với\ntôi.\n\nNhưng tôi lười đôi co với anh, ngược lại theo bậc thang đó đi xuống, lộ ra vẻ\ntrầm ngâm: “Thật sự mọi người đều nói vậy à?”\n\nTrình Hà nghiêm túc: “Phải rồi, mọi người đều nghĩ vậy.”\n\nTên của anh là chỉ tất cả mọi người?\n\nTôi im lặng một lát, gật đầu: “Có thể do gần đây em bị áp lực nặng quá, em cũng\nquyết định chuyển tâm sức từ công việc về gia đình nhiều hơn. Hôm nay em hẹn bác\nsĩ chuẩn bị điều dưỡng thân thể để mang thai. Trước khi sức khỏe em ổn định, hai\nchúng ta chia phòng ngủ nhé.”\n\nTrình Hà ngơ ngác.\n\nTôi biết anh ta luôn muốn có con, bây giờ chắc bàn tính trong lòng gõ 800 kiểu,\ntính toán tôi và Lý Như sinh con thì ai có lợi nhất cho anh ta.\n\nCứ việc tính đi, dù sao thì tôi cũng không sinh con cho anh ta.\n\nTôi không có ý định sinh con nhưng dàn trận thì làm đủ 100%.\n\nNgày hôm sau tôi đến trung tâm ở cữ sang trọng nhất thành phố.\n\nKhóa huấn luyện thai sản? Mua!\n\nKhóa âm nhạc thai giáo? Mua!\n\nY tá chọn hai phòng theo tiêu chuẩn đắt nhất, đề phòng một cái có sự cố thì còn\ncái khác dự phòng; lớp phục hồi sau sinh 3.000 tệ một tiết, tôi không do dự đặt\n30 tiết; các buổi thiền và yoga để thư giãn cho mẹ sau sinh, tất cả tôi đều mua\nhết.\n\nÀ, quên nói, chủ của trung tâm này bạn thân của tôi, người mặc cùng một chiếc\nquần thủng đáy với tôi từ nhỏ.\n\nCứ thế, tôi danh chính ngôn thuận tiêu một khoản tiền lớn trong thẻ lương, số\ntiền này đi vào tài khoản của bạn tôi, chờ tôi ly hôn xong, cô ấy sẽ trả lại cho\ntôi.\n\nTrình Hà không biết mối quan hệ của tôi với chủ trung tâm này, nhưng anh ta thấy\ntôi tiêu nhiều tiền như thế thì xót ruột.\n\nTôi bật khóc, “Đây là tiền lương của em, em vì sinh con cho anh mà bỏ tiền ra,\nvậy mà anh còn không vui…”\n\nTrình Hà không nói nên lời.\n\nNgay khi tôi đang theo phương thức đó, hăng say di dời tài sản thì một tin tức\nkinh thiên động địa truyền tới.\n\nTrợ lý tôi báo cáo xong công việc, dừng một chút rồi nói: “Chị Tống, có thể Lý\nNhư đang mang thai.”\n\n\n----------\n\nQuả nhiên Lý Như đã cuống lên.\n\nCô ta luôn tự hào mình xinh đẹp, trẻ tuổi, thích hợp để sinh con, mà gia đình\nTrình Hà xem trọng con cái nhất, đây là vũ khí lớn nhất để cô ta chiến thắng\ntôi.\n\nNhưng bây giờ tôi khua chiêng gióng trống muốn sinh con, Lý Như sợ tôi sẽ sinh\ncon trước, nếu là con trai… Trình Hà có thể bỏ rơi cô ta.\n\nMột phụ nữ sinh ra ở thế kỷ 21 mà đầu óc lại chỉ toàn quan niệm thời xã hội\nphong kiến, con vợ cả con vợ lẽ, con trưởng con thứ. Thảo nào đến cả việc copy\npaste làm cũng không tốt, chắc xem phim cung đấu quá nhiều.\n\nTrợ lý tôi tận mắt thấy Lý Như vui vẻ từ nhà vệ sinh công ty chạy ra, cô ấy đi\nvào liếc nhìn, quả nhiên thấy que thử thai ném trong thùng rác.\n\nLý Như ra khỏi nhà vệ sinh, đến chỗ yên tĩnh trong hành lang gọi điện thoại. Trợ\nlý của tôi không tiện đi theo nhưng dùng ngón chân đoán cũng biết Lý Như gọi\nđiện thoại cho Trình Hà.\n\nTrợ lý giả vờ đi ngang qua, nghe được Lý Như kích động hét to với điện thoại:\n“Nếu anh còn không ly hôn thì em sẽ phá bỏ đứa bé.”\n\nChà, bức vua thoái vị.\n\nTôi cười tủm tỉm nhận hồ sơ trên tay trợ lý, vừa ký tên vừa khen cô ấy: “Không\ntồi, thông minh nhạy bén, cuối tháng chị Tống đãi em một bữa thịnh soạn.”\n\nTrợ lý sốt ruột thay tôi: “Chị Tống, em thấy Lý Như đang ép khá chặt.”\n\n“Đừng lo.”\n\nCô ta càng ép chặt càng tốt, tốt nhất là một khóc hai nháo ba thắt cổ, khiến cả\nnhà Trình Hà rối loạn mới tốt.\n\n----------\n\nQuả nhiên cuối tuần khi về nhà, phát hiện mẹ Trình Hà đến nhà tôi.\n\nXem ra tình hình bên Trình Hà không được lạc quan nên lão tướng nhà họ Trình\ncũng ra trận.\n\nMẹ Trình Hà nhìn thấy tôi thì câu đầu tiên là: “Tiểu Tống à, nghe Trình Hà nói\ncon đang chuẩn bị mang thai, bây giờ…”\n\nTôi thay giày cao gót, thong thả mỉm cười: “Ồ, chuyện sinh con à, tháng trước\ncon có quyết định này. Nhưng hiện tại kế hoạch có thay đổi, con cảm thấy mình\ncòn có thể thăng tiến hơn ở công ty, cho nên việc sinh con để mấy năm sau rồi\ntính.”\n\nTôi vừa nói ra, sắc mặt mẹ Trình Hà đã thay đổi: “Tiểu Tống, tuổi con không còn\nnhỏ, còn hoãn thêm mấy năm thì không kịp…”\n\n“Không kịp thì không sinh thôi.” Tôi cười, “Nhà mình đâu có ngôi vị hoàng đế cần\nkế thừa.”\n\nTốt lắm, mặt mẹ Trình Hà dài như khổ qua.\n\nBuổi tối Trình Hà về đến nhà, ba người chúng tôi ăn cơm, mỗi người một suy nghĩ.\nTôi giả vờ trả lời email công việc, nhìn Trình Hà kéo mẹ anh ta vào phòng ngủ\nphụ.\n\nTôi thản nhiên đeo tai nghe bluetooth lên.\n\nPhải, biết người biết ta trăm trận trăm thắng, vì để nắm rõ tình hình quân địch\nmà tôi đã lắp máy nghe trộm trong phòng ngủ phụ. Nếu có thể bắt được chứng cứ\nTrình Hà đưa Lý Như về nhà là tốt nhất, nhưng bây giờ nghe mẹ con anh ta bàn\ntính cũng rất giá trị.\n\nTôi nghe được tiếng Trình Hà lo lắng.\n\nTrình Hà: “Mẹ, để con suy nghĩ lại.”\n\nMẹ Trình Hà sốt ruột khuyên bảo: “Còn nghĩ cái gì? Tống Duy hoàn toàn không có ý\nđịnh sinh con, bên kia Lý Như đã mang thai con cháu nhà họ Trình chúng ta!”\n\nNhìn suy nghĩ này đi, bà ta hoàn toàn không nghe vào khi tôi nói gia đình không\ncó ngai vàng để thừa kế.\n\n“Vấn đề là con lấy lý do gì để ly hôn với Tống Duy? Chẳng lẽ nói với cô ta là\ncon ngoại tình?”\n\n“Dù sao cũng phải ly hôn.” Mẹ Trình Hà nóng lòng, “Chẳng lẽ trơ mắt nhìn Tiểu Lý\nphá thai sao?”\n\n“Mẹ, để con suy nghĩ, để con suy nghĩ đã…”\n\nTốt quá, đây đúng là hướng đi tôi muốn.\n\nCảm tạ lão tướng nhà họ Trình, bà thành công đổ thêm dầu vào lửa cho Lý Như,\nkhiến Trình Hà càng lo lắng.\n\nTôi hiểu con người Trình Hà, từ công việc đến sinh hoạt thường ngày, nhược điểm\nlớn nhất là anh ta không thể chịu đựng áp lực, càng lo âu thì chỉ số thông minh\ncàng giảm, càng dễ mắc sai lầm.\n\nVà đó chính là cơ hội mà tôi muốn nắm bắt.\n\n----------\n\nNgày hôm sau, tôi hẹn Trình Hà đến quán café gần nhà, nói có việc muốn nói với\nanh ta.\n\nTrình Hà liên tục nhìn điện thoại trong tay, tôi hỏi anh ta: “Có người tìm anh\nà?”\n\nVới năng lực làm việc của anh ta thì ai mà tìm? Đơn giản là lo lắng cho Lý Như.\n\nTôi cũng không vạch trần, bình tĩnh lên tiếng: “Trình Hà, em có chuyện này muốn\nbàn với anh. Chúng ta có thể ly hôn giả không?”\n\nTrình Hà lập tức ngẩng lên, mắt sáng rực.\n\nTôi không nhịn được nói: “Anh có vẻ rất hưng phấn nhỉ?”\n\nTrình Hà sửng sốt, vội điều chỉnh biểu cảm lại: “Không phải, anh nghĩ bà xã đề\nnghị giả vờ ly hôn chắc chắn là có kế hoạch giúp nhà mình phát tài.”\n\nTrình Hà hỏi tiếp, “Là việc mua nhà à?”\n\nTôi mượn đường xuống, gật đầu: “Không sai, khu vực quận mới ở thành phố A chúng\nta có chính sách mới, nếu đàn ông mua căn nhà đầu tiên thì chính sách hỗ trợ rất\ncao. Vì vậy em nghĩ hay là chúng ta giả vờ ly hôn trước, nhà thuộc về em, như\nvậy anh có thể lấy danh nghĩa mua căn nhà đầu tiên để hưởng chính sách ưu đãi.”\n\nTrình Hà vô cùng mừng rỡ: “Thật tốt quá, bà xã, anh hoàn toàn đồng ý, cứ làm như\nlời em nói đi.”\n\nChắc hẳn anh ta cảm thấy trời cao cho anh ta cơ hội tuyệt vời.\n\nTôi vì việc mua nhà đưa ra đề nghị ly hôn giả, anh ta có thể thuận lợi ly hôn,\nmột mặt ổn định với Lý Như, để cô ta yên tâm dưỡng thai; mặt khác cũng không làm\ntổn thương quan hệ với tôi, bất kể lúc nào cũng có đường lui, có thể tái hôn,\ntiếp tục hút máu tôi.\n\nTôi đã dự liệu Trình Hà không thật lòng muốn kết hôn với Lý Như. Người đàn ông\nnày rất tính toán, không thực sự muốn từ bỏ của cải vật chất hiện có để ở bên\nmột thực tập sinh chẳng có gì trong tay ngoài tuổi trẻ.\n\nTội nghiệp Lý Như tự phụ mình tuổi trẻ xinh đẹp, cô ta cảm thấy đã đánh bại tôi,\nnhưng thực ra cô ta chỉ bị xem như một cỗ máy sinh sản.\n\nCó thể khẳng định, trong lúc ly hôn giả, Lý Như sinh con, Trình Hà có được hạt\ngiống nhà họ Trình, anh ta sẽ thần không biết quỷ không hay tái hôn với tôi,\ncuộc đời toàn thắng.\n\nTôi quay về phòng làm việc, bắt đầu soạn thảo điều khoản ly hôn. Chỉ cần nhân cơ\nhội này ly hôn với Trình Hà, tôi có thể khiến anh ta tay không rời nhà.\n\nBọ ngựa bắt ve, chim vàng anh ở phía sau, Trình Hà tự cho là người chiến thắng\ncuộc đời, chẳng qua chỉ là vai hề nhảy nhót trong mắt tôi.\n\nNhưng kế hoạch ly hôn giả cũng không thuận lợi.\n\n----------\n\nĐiều khoản ly hôn giả của tôi rất đơn giản, nhà xe tiền đều thuộc về tôi, Trình\nHà tay không rời nhà.\n\nĐây là những gì tôi kiếm được, Trình Hà không tiết kiệm được một đồng tiền\nlương, có lẽ anh ta đều tiêu cho Lý Như.\n\n“Bà xã, như thế này không tốt lắm.”\n\n“Sao vậy?” tôi chớp mắt ngây thơ, “Dù gì chúng ta cũng chỉ ly hôn giả mà.”\n\n“Nhưng thời gian từ khi ly hôn đến khi tái hôn khá dài, lỡ em yêu người khác thì\nsao?”\n\nCó lẽ Trình Hà về bàn bạc với bố mẹ anh ta và Lý Như, tóm lại anh ta kiên quyết:\n“Không được, bà xã, như thế này anh mạo hiểm quá lớn. Nếu anh không có tài sản\nđảm bảo, vậy anh sẽ không ly hôn.”\n\nTôi ngẫm nghĩ: “Hay là thế này, chúng ta viết thỏa thuận, nhà xe em chỉ đại diện\ngiữ thôi, nếu anh cần thì cứ lấy lại.”\n\nTrình Hà không ngờ tôi hào phóng vậy, mắt lập tức sáng như đèn: “Bà xã, em bằng\nlòng làm vậy sao?”\n\n“Tất nhiên rồi, chúng ta là vợ chồng, em phải để anh có lòng tin chứ.”\n\nTrình Hà lén tôi điện thoại về nhà, sau đó vui vẻ quay lại: “Vậy được, chúng ta\nquyết định như vậy đi.”\n\nTôi nhìn thấy ánh mắt anh ta đảo quanh. Dựa theo hiểu biết nhiều năm của tôi về\nanh ta, tôi biết anh ta cảm thấy nếu có được thỏa thuận ủy thác phần lớn tài sản\nthì nếu vụ ly hôn này giả biến thành thật cũng không phải là không thể.\n\nAnh ta lấy nhà, xe của tôi, hoàn toàn đá tôi đi, tìm một cô gái xinh đẹp, trẻ\ntrung.\n\nTôi đến tìm bạn thân uống trà. Bạn thân nghe xong suýt nữa ném vỡ tách.\n\n“Tống Duy, mày đang làm gì? Mày hỏng đầu rồi sao? Thế này không phải tương đương\nvới việc đưa tiền cho tên sở khanh, cho ả nhân tình kia sao?”\n\n“Đưa thì đưa thôi.” Tôi cầm tách trà Long Tỉnh nóng, nhấp từng ngụm nhỏ, “Vợ\nchồng mấy năm, anh ta đã có con rồi, xem như tao tặng món quà, dù gì tiền không\ncòn thì có thể kiếm, coi như trả giá cho tình cảm ngày xưa của tụi tao.”\n\nBạn thân tức nghẹn, chỉ tay vào tôi, tay run run cả buổi không thốt nên lời.\n\nTôi nhìn mặt cô ấy đỏ bừng, phì cười.\n\n“Được rồi được rồi, không đùa với mày nữa.” Tôi buông tách trà, cắn một miếng\nbánh hạnh nhân, cảm nhận vị ngọt tan trên đầu lưỡi, “Tống Duy tao chưa bao giờ\nngã hai lần cùng một chỗ, lúc trước đầu óc yêu đương mụ mị chọn thằng chồng khốn\nnạn, bây giờ sao có thể yêu lú đầu lần nữa?”\n\nSắc mặt bạn thân lúc này mới dịu lại nhưng vẫn còn băn khoăn: “Nhưng mày đưa nhà\nxe cho anh ta…”\n\n“Trình Hà cũng nghĩ vậy.” Tôi cười, cầm miếng bánh hạnh nhân thứ hai, “Tuy tao\nlàm kinh doanh nhiều năm như vậy, nhưng mày còn nhớ tao học đại học chuyên ngành\ngì chứ?”\n\n“… Luật.”\n\n“Ừ.” Tôi cười, “Cảm ơn Trình Hà đã để tao ôn lại kiến thức chuyên ngành. Giấy\nthỏa thuận ly hôn đã ký xong, kế tiếp chờ xem bọn họ diễn là được.”\n\n\n----------\n\nSau khi Lý Như mang thai thì không còn tâm tư đi làm nữa, nghỉ việc về nhà dưỡng\nthai.\n\nSự thật chứng minh, con người Trình Hà rất bất an, không theo đuổi kích thích\nthì có lẽ anh ta thấy khó chịu.\n\nLý Như về nhà dưỡng thai, nhà xe của tôi thành công đến tay anh ta, lập tức anh\nta cảm thấy hài lòng về bản thân, cảm thấy mình là vua một cõi, lại bắt đầu tìm\nkiếm tình yêu công sở mới.\n\nHiện giờ tôi không cần quản lý anh ta.\n\nVì thế khi anh ta ở phòng trà tán tỉnh cô nhân viên trẻ, đồng nghiệp lén báo với\ntôi, tôi lập tức đến đó “vô tình nhìn thấy hết mọi việc”.\n\nTôi kéo cô gái kia ra sau lưng, chỉ trích Trình Hà làm bại hoại không khí công\nty. Đồng nghiệp sôi nổi đến xem, mặt Trình Hà hết đỏ rồi lại trắng.\n\nTại cuộc họp tổng kết quý, tôi chính xác, tàn nhẫn chỉ ra hiệu suất công việc\nTrình Hà đã ở vị trí cuối bảng trong ba tháng liên tiếp, phù hợp nguyên tắc tối\nưu hóa của công ty. Cứ thế, Trình Hà mất việc.\n\nĐêm đó về nhà, tôi bị Trình Hà chặn cửa: “Tống Duy, cô có ý gì?”\n\nTôi bình thản: “Việc nào ra việc đó, hiệu suất công việc của anh chót bảng là sự\nthật.”\n\nTrình Hà cười lạnh: “Tôi đã nói mà, loại đàn bà như cô máu lạnh cực kỳ, tôi ly\nhôn với cô là đúng.”\n\nỒ, bắt đầu rồi bắt đầu rồi. Rốt cuộc muốn xé rách mặt với tôi?\n\nSự phấn khích của tôi muốn tràn ra ngoài nhưng tôi phải cố hết sức kiềm nén lại,\nlộ vẻ kinh ngạc.\n\nTrên xe từ phía xa, Lý Như ễnh cái bụng to đi xuống, níu tay Trình Hà: “Đừng nói\nvới chị ta nữa, chúng ta đi thôi.”\n\nTôi kinh hãi nhìn bụng Lý Như, rồi nhìn Trình Hà: “…”\n\nLý Như diễu võ dương oai cười với tôi: “Tôi với anh Trình Hà đã ở bên nhau.”\n\nTôi cực kỳ buồn bã: “Đứa trẻ là của anh ấy?”\n\n“Ừ, thì sao?” Lý Như mỉm cười, xoa xoa bụng, “Chị không muốn sinh con cho anh\nTrình Hà, tôi sẵn lòng.”\n\n“Mấy tháng rồi?” Tôi muốn xông lên túm cổ áo Trình Hà, “Có phải hai người đã ở\nbên nhau trước khi chúng ta ly hôn…”\n\nLý Như cố ý chắn trước mặt Trình Hà, tôi dừng lực kịp lúc nhưng cô ta vẫn lảo\nđảo, yếu ớt ngã vào lòng Trình Hà.\n\n“Anh Trình Hà…” Lý Như tủi thân nũng nịu.\n\nTrình Hà ôm Lý Như, lạnh lùng nhìn tôi.\n\n“Tống Duy, chuyện đến nước này, rốt cuộc tôi có thể nói với cô.” Trình Hà thản\nnhiên, “Bao nhiêu năm kết hôn với cô, tôi chưa từng có tôn nghiêm của một người\nđàn ông.”\n\nKhông phải chứ, anh bạn. Là anh muốn cưới tôi.\n\n“Chúng ta vào công ty cùng một thời điểm, cô thăng tiến ngày một nhanh, thu nhập\nngày càng cao, có từng suy nghĩ đến cảm nhận của tôi không?”\n\nVậy thì sao?\n\nVì để ý cảm xúc của anh mà tôi phải từ chối thăng chức tăng lương?\n\n“Mấy năm nay tôi luôn nhân nhượng cô.”\n\nBởi vì anh cần tiêu tiền của tôi.\n\n“Bây giờ cuối cùng tôi đã không cần phải chịu đựng cô. Tống Duy, dù sao chúng ta\ncũng đã ly hôn. Nghĩ tình bao nhiêu năm qua, chúng ta chia tay êm đẹp đi.”\n\nTôi đứng trong gió lạnh nhìn Trình Hà.\n\n“Cái gì là chia tay êm đẹp?” Giọng tôi lạnh băng, “Trình Hà, ý của anh là tôi\nđưa nhà – xe cho anh, sau đó rời đi?”\n\n“Nhà xe vốn dĩ là của tôi.” Trình Hà nói, “Cô chỉ giữ thay tôi thôi.”\n\nTôi thoáng thấy vẻ đắc ý lướt qua mặt anh ta, có lẽ anh ta nghĩ mình ký bản thỏa\nthuận kia thật thông minh, biết tính toán chiến lược.\n\nTôi quay người đi vào nhà: “Tôi không dọn đi, có bản lĩnh thì anh gọi luật sư\nđi.”\n\n----------\n\nLần này khả năng hành động của Trình Hà không tồi, nói gọi luật sư thì gọi luật\nsư đến thật.\n\nCũng khó trách, anh ta, Lý Như, bố mẹ anh ta 4 người sống trong căn hộ thuê. Anh\nta và Lý Như không có công việc, dựa vào tiền lương hưu của bố mẹ anh ta để duy\ntrì cuộc sống, họ muốn dọn đến căn hộ rộng rãi thoáng đãng của tôi lâu rồi.\n\nKhi đến nhà tôi, bố mẹ Trình, Trình Hà, Lý Như và luật sư, cả đoàn 5 người đông\nđủ.\n\nTôi nhìn hai vợ chồng già, thở dài: “Chú Trình, lúc trước chú phải phẫu thuật,\nlà tôi vận dụng những mối quan hệ tìm phòng bệnh cho chú. Chi phí chăm sóc hậu\nphẫu cũng là tôi chi trả. Tôi còn nhớ, khi khỏi bệnh chú còn nắm tay tôi nói tôi\nnhư con gái ruột của mình.”\n\nBố Trình sắc mặt rất khó coi, quay đầu đi.\n\n“Còn cô Trình, lần đầu tiên cô đến nhà tôi, nhìn thấy mỹ phẩm dưỡng da của tôi,\nnói từ trước đến giờ chưa từng được sử dụng những món đồ tốt như vậy, có phải\ntôi cũng mua cho cô nguyên cả bộ? Tại sao chuyện Trình Hà ngoại tình hai người\nđã biết từ lâu mà không ai nói với tôi?”\n\nBố Trình lên tiếng trước: “Tiểu Tống à, chuyện trước kia là chuyện trước kia,\nbây giờ chúng ta việc nào ra việc đó.”\n\nMẹ Trình vội vàng phụ họa: “Phải phải, Tiểu Tống, chúng ta phải nói chuyện theo\npháp luật, bất động sản, xe, nhà này là của Trình Hà nhà chúng tôi, cô chỉ đại\ndiện giữ. Bây giờ Trình Hà cần, cô phải trả lại. Tình cảm là tình cảm, cô chú\nkhông hiểu tình hình mấy người trẻ các cháu, nhưng vấn đề pháp luật thì phải dựa\nvào pháp luật để giải quyết.”\n\nHai người kẻ xướng người họa, cho dù tôi có chuẩn bị tâm lý trước thì vẫn bị\nkhơi dậy oán khí trong lòng.\n\nTôi liếc Lý Như: “Làm khó một phụ nữ mang thai như cô đến giúp tạo thanh thế.\nTrình Hà đăng ký kết hôn với cô chưa?”\n\nLý Như khựng lại.\n\nTôi lắc đầu: “Thật đáng thương, đứa bé đã 8 tháng mà còn chưa có tờ hôn thú. Cô\nnhìn cái gia đình vong ân phụ nghĩa này đi, cô thực sự cảm thấy mình có thể dựa\nvào đứa trẻ để đổi lấy lòng biết ơn của gia đình này à?”\n\nMặt Lý Như đỏ bừng. Trình Hà nổi giận đứng lên.\n\n“Tống Duy, hôm nay chúng ta đến nói chuyện nhà xe, cô không cần ở đây nói đông\nnói tây. Gia đình tôi thế nào không đến lượt cô chỉ trích.”\n\nAnh ta chỉ luật sư: “Huống hồ hôm nay còn có người ngoài.”\n\nTôi cười: “Tôi chỉ nói ra mấy lời trong lòng thôi, sau này không còn cơ hội\nnữa.”\n\nTôi chuyển hướng sang người ngoài duy nhất nơi này, cuối cùng vào vấn đề chính.\n\n“Anh ta không có hồ sơ thanh toán.” Tôi bình tĩnh nói.\n\nLuật sư là người chuyên nghiệp, với đầu óc của Trình Hà, chắc hẳn trước đó không\nnói rõ tình hình với luật sư. Bây giờ vừa nghe tôi nói thế, luật sư lập tức thay\nđổi sắc mặt.\n\nKhông chỉ bố mẹ Trình Hà, cả Trình Hà và Lý Như không hiểu ra sao, mắt to trừng\nmắt nhỏ, không hiểu tôi đang nói gì.\n\nTôi lấy trong túi xách ra những giấy tờ chứng minh tôi là người thanh toán.\n\nXe, tôi thanh toán toàn bộ.\n\nNhà, tôi trả cọc, sau đó tất cả các khoản vay đều do tôi thanh toán.\n\n“Ông Trình, trước đó anh không nói với tôi bất động sản, nhà, xe là do vợ cũ của\nanh chi trả.”\n\nLuật sư quay sang Trình Hà, “Trong trường hợp này, thỏa thuận vô hiệu.”\n\nTrên mặt bốn người kia chỉ có một biểu cảm…\n\nSét đánh giữa trời quang.\n\nTôi cười nhẹ, thu lại những chứng cứ.\n\n“Được rồi, không phải hôm nay nói về chuyện tài sản, nhà xe sao? Nói xong rồi.\nKhông còn chuyện gì khác thì tôi muốn nghỉ ngơi. Đây là nhà tôi, mời các vị mau\nrời khỏi đây.”\n\nLý Như hét lên một tiếng, ngất xỉu.\n\nDù gì cũng là phụ nữ mang thai, chậm trễ không tốt. Tôi nhanh chóng gọi 120,\ntiễn cả gia đình này đi.\n\n----------\n\nLý Như không sao, bình an sinh ra một cậu con trai.\n\nTuy không có tài sản nhưng dù gì họ cũng có được đứa cháu trai như mơ ước, nhà\nhọ Trình có thể được an ủi phần nào.\n\nVốn dĩ tôi muốn hoàn toàn cắt đứt với gia đình này, không ngờ một hôm về nhà,\ntôi nhìn thấy một người đang quỳ trong hành lang tối om.\n\nTôi giật mình hét lên, đèn cảm ứng bật sáng, lúc này tôi mới nhận ra người quỳ\nlà Trình Hà.\n\nTrình Hà đỏ bừng mắt nói với tôi, anh ta đã quỳ 3 tiếng đồng hồ.\n\nCó phải quỳ thật 3 tiếng không, tôi không biết. Tôi chỉ biết anh ta quỳ trên tấm\nthảm trước cửa nhà tôi, rất thông minh. Ngay cả sám hối cũng không quên làm kẻ\nlười biếng, làm cho bản thân dễ chịu.\n\nTrình Hà vừa khóc vừa nói với tôi, anh ta sai rồi. Sau thời gian dài, anh ta\nnhận ra người anh ta yêu nhất là tôi.\n\nTôi thở dài.\n\nCó lẽ anh ta tưởng tôi không biết. Nhưng trên đời này không có bức tường nào\nkhông lọt gió, những lời đàm tiếu của đồng nghiệp cuối cùng lọt vào tai tôi.\n\nCon trai Lý Như sinh ra không phải của Trình Hà.\n\nTrình Hà có thể phát triển tình yêu công sở, đi làm một người tan làm một người,\ntất nhiên Lý Như cũng có thể.\n\nLúc đó cô ta có 2 đối tượng, Trình Hà thực ra là lốp dự phòng, người kia là một\nthiếu gia con nhà giàu. Nhưng mà thiếu gia kia còn trẻ, quá mê chơi, sao có thể\ndễ dàng rửa tay gác kiếm chịu sự kiểm soát.\n\nKhi Lý Như mang thai con của cậu ta, cậu ta cũng chỉ bảo Lý Như phá đi.\n\nSo sánh hai bên giữa cậu ấm kia với Trình Hà, người như có ngai vàng trong nhà\ncần thừa kế, đang mong ngóng con trai thì Trình Hà dễ xử lý hơn.\n\nCứ thế, Lý Như dựa vào con người khác đến giành thân phận cháu đích tôn nhà họ\nTrình. Đáng tiếc điều kiện kinh tế nhà họ Trình xuống dốc không phanh, Lý Như ở\nnhà chăm con hết khóc lóc lại gây rối.\n\nBan đầu Trình Hà vì con nên nhẫn nhịn, kết quả sau lần cãi nhau to, Lý Như bất\nchấp đem chuyện con trai không phải của Trình Hà nói ra.\n\nGiờ thì tốt rồi, vợ chồng son trong nhà đánh nhau, mắt Lý Như bầm xanh, Trình Hà\nrách mặt. Hàng xóm báo cảnh sát, hai người cùng bị đưa đến đồn, nổi tiếng khắp\nphố.\n\nSau trò hề này, Lý Như bế con đi đến nhà cậu ấm kia đòi tiền. Trình Hà đến chỗ\ntôi diễn tiết mục gương vỡ lại lành.\n\nTrước đây khi còn yêu nhau, mỗi lần cãi nhau muốn chia tay, Trình Hà đều diễn\ncảnh quỳ gối này, lần nào tôi cũng mềm lòng, cảm thấy người đàn ông này thật\nlòng yêu mình.\n\nNhưng bây giờ tôi đã hiểu rõ, đây không phải là yêu. Biểu hiện bi kịch hóa này\nchứng minh nó là diễn trò.\n\nTôi cười bất lực: “Trình Hà, tôi đã kết hôn.”\n\nTrình Hà sốc.\n\n“Chồng tôi cao 1 mét 85, cơ bắp, đang đậu xe dưới lầu. Nếu anh không đi, anh ấy\nsẽ lên tới, tôi không ngăn được việc anh ấy đánh anh đâu.”\n\nTrình Hà sợ hãi bỏ đi, tôi xác định anh ta đi rồi mới mở cửa vào phòng khách.\nThoải mái thả người lên sô pha, tôi mở điện thoại gọi đồ ăn. Trong lúc chờ pizza\ngà gà rán đến thì xem mấy chương trình tạp kỹ hài hước.\n\nTất nhiên tôi không có chồng mới, nhưng bạn thấy đấy, cuộc sống một người chẳng\nphải cũng rất vui vẻ đấy sao?\n\nMột cuộc hôn nhân thất bại có lẽ sẽ phá hỏng vận may của một người, tóm lại, sau\nkhi hoàn toàn thoát khỏi Trình Hà, tôi lại tiến thêm một bước trên đường sự\nnghiệp. Sếp ám chỉ, chỉ cần tôi duy trì phong độ hiện tại, tôi sẽ sớm trở thành\nnữ quản lý cấp cao trẻ nhất hội đồng quản trị công ty.\n\nTôi có nhà, có xe, có tiền, có sự nghiệp, con đường tương lai tươi sáng.\n\nCòn việc có chồng con hay không thì có liên quan gì?\n\n----------\n\nSau này, con Lý Như được gia đình cậu ấm kia thừa nhận, đứa bé được giao cho ông\nbà nội nuôi dưỡng nhưng Lý Như không được chấp nhận.\n\nMẹ cậu ấm nhà giàu kia cho Lý Như một khoản tiền để cô ta không bao giờ xuất\nhiện trước mặt họ nữa.\n\nNghe tin này tôi cũng nhẹ nhõm, dù sao thì đứa trẻ cũng vô tội, đi theo người mẹ\nnhư Lý Như sẽ chịu khổ. Bây giờ đứa bé cũng xem như có được kết quả tốt đẹp.\n\nVốn dĩ Lý Như đã nhận được một khoản tiền, nếu cầm đi buôn bán nhỏ hoặc đăng ký\ncác lớp học nâng cao bản thân thì cũng đủ để nửa đời sau cô ta sống tốt đẹp.\nNhưng Lý Như đã quen đi đường tắt, không thể trở lại cuộc sống bình thường. Cô\nta biến thành cô gái “phong bao đỏ” trong hộp đêm, ai cho cô ta nhiều lì xì thì\ncô ta đi với người đó.\n\nNhưng cuộc sống đó luôn có những người mới xuất hiện, trẻ hơn, đẹp hơn, cuộc\nsống Lý Như ngày càng quẫn bách. Tôi không biết nếu có ngày cô ta không còn nhận\nđược tiền từ đàn ông nữa thì cô ta sẽ lấy gì để nuôi thân.\n\nCuộc sống của Trình Hà cũng không tốt đẹp. Anh ta theo bố mẹ về quê, nghe đồn\nlàm giả lý lịch, ở rể một gia đình nơi quê nhà. Bố mẹ vợ tính tình nóng nảy, hơn\nnữa yêu cầu con sinh ra cũng theo họ nhà gái, đối với việc này, bố mẹ Trình như\nbị xẻo thịt, nhưng ở dưới mái hiên nhà người không thể không cúi đầu.\n\nCòn tôi?\n\nTôi thành công nhận được cổ phiếu và quyền lợi tương ứng, trở thành thành viên\ntrẻ nhất của Hội đồng quản trị.\n\nNhững đồng nghiệp mới đến nghe chuyện năm đó của tôi, khi gặp tôi ở phòng trà họ\ncũng hỏi thăm, tôi chỉ cười trừ, không bận tâm.\n\nMọi tin đồn chỉ như gió thoảng mây trôi. Sau khi mây tan, người có tài có lực sẽ\nluôn vững như bàn thạch.\n\nTôi biết, tương lai của tôi vẫn đầy hứa hẹn.\n\n- --Hết---",

        "illustration": "**Static Scene Description:**\n\n**Setting:**  \nThe scene unfolds in a dimly lit conference room, characterized by harsh overhead lights casting a dull glow on beige, sterile walls. The atmosphere is thick with tension, the air heavy with disbelief. Seated in tightly packed rows, 52 employees, diverse in age and ethnicity, are captured mid-reaction. Their faces range from shock to dismay, eyes wide and glued to the large screen at the front, which showcases the unfolding drama of the video call.\n\n**Background Details:**  \nThe backdrop is minimalist, featuring a long, polished conference table that reflects the light, bordered by modern ergonomic chairs. A large projection screen displays a well-defined image of Trình Hà and Lý Như, their figures intimately close. Outside the room, large glass windows reveal a dreary sky filled with swirling gray clouds, hinting at an impending storm, symbolic of the brewing turmoil within.\n\nIn the corner, a small potted plant strains to flourish, representing resilience in a lifeless environment.

Her expression is raw, a complex mix of heart-wrenching isolation and simmering resolve as she records the betrayal unfolding before her. Her eyes narrow, highlighting the fierce determination in the midst of her despair.\n\n**Mood and Emotions:**  \nThe scene is laden with an oppressive atmosphere, the silence punctuated only by the hum of the laptop and distant, echoing laughter. The employees' expressions capture a collective disbelief, mirroring the protagonist’s internal chaos as she balances her professionalism against a web of emotional turmoil and betrayal. The warm light attempts to soften the cold reality of the event, yet fails to dispel the palpable tension, encapsulating the narrow divide between hope and despair in this critical moment.",

The contrast between old and new architecture symbolizes the clash between traditional values and modern aspirations.\n  - **Interior Spaces:** Tống Nguyệt’s home is warm and inviting, filled with cultural artifacts that signify her heritage but feels sterile and controlling after the betrayal. Corporate offices are sleek, cold, and monochromatic, depicting the high stakes of power and ambition as well as the pressure and isolation felt within them. \n  - **Vibrant Markets:** Colorful street markets provide a stark contrast, representing life outside the corporate world and depicting community and support, where traditional roles resonate.\n  \n- **Cultural Elements:** The societal expectations regarding motherhood and career aspirations heavily influence the environments.

The walls are adorned with soft, muted colors—perhaps a pale blue or soft gray—that contrast beautifully with dark wooden accents in the furniture and decor. A plush rug covers the hardwood floor, providing warmth and comfort, while the furniture arrangement invites conversation but also reflects an underlying tension.\n\nAs dusk settles in, the last golden rays of sunlight filter through sheer white curtains, illuminating the room with a soft, ethereal glow. Long shadows stretch across the floor, created by the gently swaying curtains that sway slightly in an unseen breeze, adding a dynamic element to the stillness of the scene. A delicate side table holds a stylish lamp, which remains off, allowing the dusk light to dominate, but its presence signifies an impending shift from light to darkness—a metaphor for the hidden truths in their conversation.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n1. **Trình Hà:** \n   - He is portrayed sitting nervously on a deep, rich-colored velvet sofa, its plush texture emphasized by the dim lighting.

Her hair is styled neatly, framing her face and drawing attention to her keen, piercing eyes that seem to see right through Trình Hà.\n   - Her demeanor is relaxed, leaning back in her chair, arms crossed casually yet ready to pounce at any moment, suggesting a psychological chess match. \n\n**Interaction:**\nIn the middle ground, the phone stands as a pivotal element of the scene, positioned on the center table between them. Its screen glows softly, casting an artificial light that underscores the tension. Trình Hà's reflection is visible, showing his strained features against the darkening room, while the protagonist's expression is more illuminated, further emphasizing the power dynamics at play.\n\n**Mood:**\nThe overall mood is charged with suspense and unease. The interplay of light and shadow creates a sense of unease reflective of their conversation's nature—filled with unspoken truths and veiled threats. The air is thick with tension, suggesting that while the dialogue may appear casual, both individuals are caught in a broader, more dangerous game of wits. The combination of their contrasting expressions—his anxiety against her confidence—invokes a palpable sense of anticipation, leaving viewers with questions about what lies beneath the surface of their exchange. \n\nThis static moment encapsulates a rich narrative, drawing viewers into the complex dynamics of their relationship, as they navigate the treacherous waters of truth and deception.",

        "illustration": "**Static Scene Description:**\n\n**Setting:**  \nThe scene is set in a softly lit living room that exudes elegance but carries an undercurrent of tension. A plush sofa, adorned with a few decorative cushions, is positioned center stage, creating an intimate yet claustrophobic atmosphere. On one side of the room, a wooden coffee table holds a few scattered books and the water glass that Duy Duy holds, glistening under the warm glow of a vintage table lamp. This light, with its amber hue, casts long, dramatic shadows that accentuate the stark contrasts between the figures seated across from each other.\n\n**Background Details:**  \nThe walls are painted in a soothing cream color, adorned with simplistic artwork that suggests warmth, yet the frames have accumulated dust, hinting at neglect. In the corner, a colorful ceramic vase filled with wilting flowers speaks volumes of their diminishing vibrancy, much like their relationship. A framed wedding photo hangs slightly askew on the wall, portraying their smiling faces, but the wear evident in the photograph’s corners reveals a history of strain beneath the surface.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n- **Trình Hà:**  \nSeated rigidly on the sofa, Trình Hà's expression is a sculpture of seriousness and concern. His hair is neatly styled, and he wears a crisp button-up shirt, sleeves rolled halfway, suggesting an attempt at a casual demeanor that falters against the weight of his emotions. His brow is slightly furrowed, and his lips are pressed together, embodying the struggle he faces in articulating his thoughts. One hand rests on the arm of the sofa, tense and clenched, while the other is poised at his knee, further compounding his rigid posture.\n\n- **Duy Duy:**  \nIn stark contrast, Duy Duy appears relaxed yet carefully calculated. She sits back slightly on the sofa, holding a glass of water close to her chest, her fingers lightly tapping on the rim—an unconscious indicator of her brewing amusement. Her hair cascades over one shoulder, framing a face adorned with a sly, almost sardonic smile that refuses to meet the intensity of Trình Hà’s gaze. She is dressed in a casual but stylish outfit that suggests confidence, yet her eyes betray a storm brewing beneath her composed surface.

        "style": "**Master Concept for Storyboard: \"The Betrayal Chronicles\"**\n\n**Overarching Concept:**\n\"The Betrayal Chronicles\" is a contemporary drama set in modern-day Vietnam, a society grappling with traditional values and the fast-paced nature of urban life. The characters navigate personal betrayals and societal expectations within the constructs of family, career, and gender roles. The rich cultural backdrop of Vietnam serves as a canvas for illustrating the intricate relationships and power dynamics at play. The story’s visual exploration centers on themes of betrayal, identity, and the pursuit of autonomy amidst societal pressures.\n\n### World Design:\n- **Environments:** \n  - **Urban Landscape:** The story primarily unfolds in a bustling urban environment of Ho Chi Minh City, with skyscrapers, corporate offices, and traditional Vietnamese architecture blending seamlessly. The contrast between old and new architecture symbolizes the clash between traditional values and modern aspirations.\n  - **Interior Spaces:** Tống Nguyệt’s home is warm and inviting, filled with cultural artifacts that signify her heritage but feels sterile and controlling after the betrayal. Corporate offices are sleek, cold, and monochromatic, depicting the high stakes of power and ambition as well as the pressure and isolation felt within them. \n  - **Vibrant Markets:** Colorful street markets provide a stark contrast, representing life outside the corporate world and depicting community and support, where traditional roles resonate.\n  \n- **Cultural Elements:** The societal expectations regarding motherhood and career aspirations heavily influence the environments. The story exemplifies how these pressures manifest in Tống Nguyệt’s internal conflicts, highlighted through interactions in homes and workplaces. The juxtaposition of bustling corporate life against the more intimate world of family underscores the conflicting demands on women.\n\n### Characters:\n- **Tống Nguyệt:**\n  - *Appearance:* In her early 30s, Tống Nguyệt has an air of quiet strength, with long hair tied back neatly, signifying her disciplined nature. She has defined facial features that convey resilience—sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes that reflect her determination.\n  - *Attire:* She wears professional attire that is smart yet modest, favoring dark, earthy tones that blend with the backdrop of the corporate world; she occasionally inserts subtle elements of traditional Vietnamese fashion, like a silk scarf.\n  - *Visual Traits:* A meticulous planner, she carries a stylish yet functional binder filled with notes that she consults during her confrontations, showcasing her strategic mind.\n\n- **Trình Khải:**\n  - *Appearance:* In his late 30s, Trình Khải is handsome but carries an air of arrogance. He has a short, neat haircut and a confident posture that exudes entitlement.\n  - *Attire:* He dresses in designer suits that reflect his corporate success. His clothing varies from sharp navy suits to casual yet expensive attire, which conveys his status and lifestyle.\n  - *Visual Traits:* A faint scar above his left eyebrow hints at a reckless past, subtly revealing that beneath his polished exterior lies vulnerability and insecurity.\n\n- **Lý Nhi:**\n  - *Appearance:* A young and ambitious intern in her early 20s, Lý Nhi has a youthful, fresh look with soft features and a hairstyle that matches the latest trends. Despite her confidence, her wide eyes reveal her youthful naivety.\n  - *Attire:* Lý Nhi often wears trendy, youthful attire that reflects her ambition—bright colors and stylish cuts that embody her desire to stand out and succeed in a male-dominated environment.\n  - *Visual Traits:* A noticeable bracelet given by Tống Nguyệt symbolizes her initial acceptance by the family, which ultimately highlights her fall from grace when the betrayal is revealed.\n\n### Mood & Tone:\n- **Visual Mood:** The story oscillates between moments of vibrancy and muted tones, paralleling the emotional journeys of the characters. Corporate settings are portrayed with stark, cold lighting, representing the pressure and isolation within the professional world. In contrast, scenes of familial interactions and street environments are warm, reflecting complexity and human connection.\n- **Camera Techniques:** Close-ups capture the characters' emotional states, particularly Tống Nguyệt's determination, Trình Khải’s fear, and Lý Nhi’s vulnerability. Wide shots in negotiation scenes highlight power dynamics, while even light and shadow play a role in depicting the tension and underlying themes of betrayal and resilience.\n- **Color Palette:** The color palette shifts from dark blues and grays in corporate settings to warm yellows and greens in familial or public spaces, reinforcing the dichotomy between personal life and work life.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\"The Betrayal Chronicles\" is visually composed to reflect a modern Vietnamese society where the pressures of career and motherhood intersect. The characters are meticulously designed to embody their struggles and aspirations, with their environments reflecting their internal turmoil and societal expectations. The storyboard will effectively capture their emotional arcs, showcasing the complex interplay of power, betrayal, and the pursuit of autonomy in a captivating, thought-provoking narrative.",

        "illustration": "**Storyboard Scene Description**\n\n**Title: The Tension of Ambition**\n\n**Background Setting:**  \nThe scene is set in a sterile office corridor that conveys the corporate setting's coldness and rigidity. The walls are painted in muted pastel colors—soft blues and warm beiges—that seem to absorb the light rather than reflect it. This subdued color palette clashes with the sharpness of fluorescent lighting that pours harshly down from above, casting stark shadows and highlights throughout the space. In the backdrop, faint whispers echo, hinting at the corporate gossip and pressures that hang in the air like a thick fog. The corridor stretches into the distance, lined with nondescript doors, each representing a different office, but all contribute to the same atmosphere of ambition and unease.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n- **Lý Như:**  \n  Lý Như stands prominently in the foreground, her figure is both commanding and frail at the same time. She wears a sleek, tailored suit—perhaps in a dark navy or charcoal—that complements her athletic silhouette. The fabric clings elegantly, suggesting professionalism while still hinting at femininity. Her glossy hair is pulled back into a polished bun, though a few loose strands escape, subtly highlighting her distressed state. Her eyes are wide with a mix of panic and determination, reflecting the harsh lighting and the emotional turmoil within her. In her right hand, she clutches her smartphone tightly, knuckles white with anxiety, while her left fist is clenched at her side. The delicate rings on her fingers catch the fluorescent light, glinting like shards of her crumbling composure.\n\n- **Rival (Unnamed):**  \n  Slightly positioned in the shadowy recess of the corridor, her rival exudes an air of poise and confidence that is unsettlingly calm compared to Lý Như's fraught demeanor. She has long, flowing hair that drapes over her shoulders, softening her sharp features. Her attire contrasts with Lý Như's—perhaps a flowing blouse in a light shade paired with a structured blazer, projecting a composed yet stylish impression. A slight smirk plays on her lips, hinting at a knowing superiority and the underlying tension of their rivalry. She observes Lý Như, her posture relaxed, embodying the calm before the storm.\n\n**Foreground Elements:**\n\n- **Garbage Bin:**  \n  A plastic garbage bin spills over with used pregnancy tests, the bright white and subtle pink wrappers stark against the muted tones of the corridor. This detail serves as a powerful symbol of desperation and unfulfilled aspirations, quietly amplifying the moment's emotional weight and tension.\n\n**Mood and Atmosphere:**  \nThe air is thick with anticipation as Lý Như stands at the crossroads of her ambition and personal turmoil. The lighting sharply contrasts with the muted decor, intensifying the feeling of isolation within a corporate world that thrives on success but hides personal struggles. The tension is almost tangible, creating an unsettling atmosphere where the stakes are high. The scene captures a moment of confrontation, fraught with emotion—a fragile equilibrium poised to shatter at any moment.\n\nThe tableau frozen in time captures the essence of ambition’s darker side, where personal dreams clash with harsh realities, embodied by two figures who embody the complexity of competition and inner conflict.",

        "style": "**Master Concept for Storyboard: \"The Betrayal Chronicles\"**\n\n**Overarching Concept:**\n\"The Betrayal Chronicles\" is a contemporary drama set in modern-day Vietnam, a society grappling with traditional values and the fast-paced nature of urban life. The characters navigate personal betrayals and societal expectations within the constructs of family, career, and gender roles. The rich cultural backdrop of Vietnam serves as a canvas for illustrating the intricate relationships and power dynamics at play. The story’s visual exploration centers on themes of betrayal, identity, and the pursuit of autonomy amidst societal pressures.\n\n### World Design:\n- **Environments:** \n  - **Urban Landscape:** The story primarily unfolds in a bustling urban environment of Ho Chi Minh City, with skyscrapers, corporate offices, and traditional Vietnamese architecture blending seamlessly. The contrast between old and new architecture symbolizes the clash between traditional values and modern aspirations.\n  - **Interior Spaces:** Tống Nguyệt’s home is warm and inviting, filled with cultural artifacts that signify her heritage but feels sterile and controlling after the betrayal. Corporate offices are sleek, cold, and monochromatic, depicting the high stakes of power and ambition as well as the pressure and isolation felt within them. \n  - **Vibrant Markets:** Colorful street markets provide a stark contrast, representing life outside the corporate world and depicting community and support, where traditional roles resonate.\n  \n- **Cultural Elements:** The societal expectations regarding motherhood and career aspirations heavily influence the environments. The story exemplifies how these pressures manifest in Tống Nguyệt’s internal conflicts, highlighted through interactions in homes and workplaces. The juxtaposition of bustling corporate life against the more intimate world of family underscores the conflicting demands on women.\n\n### Characters:\n- **Tống Nguyệt:**\n  - *Appearance:* In her early 30s, Tống Nguyệt has an air of quiet strength, with long hair tied back neatly, signifying her disciplined nature. She has defined facial features that convey resilience—sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes that reflect her determination.\n  - *Attire:* She wears professional attire that is smart yet modest, favoring dark, earthy tones that blend with the backdrop of the corporate world; she occasionally inserts subtle elements of traditional Vietnamese fashion, like a silk scarf.\n  - *Visual Traits:* A meticulous planner, she carries a stylish yet functional binder filled with notes that she consults during her confrontations, showcasing her strategic mind.\n\n- **Trình Khải:**\n  - *Appearance:* In his late 30s, Trình Khải is handsome but carries an air of arrogance. He has a short, neat haircut and a confident posture that exudes entitlement.\n  - *Attire:* He dresses in designer suits that reflect his corporate success. His clothing varies from sharp navy suits to casual yet expensive attire, which conveys his status and lifestyle.\n  - *Visual Traits:* A faint scar above his left eyebrow hints at a reckless past, subtly revealing that beneath his polished exterior lies vulnerability and insecurity.\n\n- **Lý Nhi:**\n  - *Appearance:* A young and ambitious intern in her early 20s, Lý Nhi has a youthful, fresh look with soft features and a hairstyle that matches the latest trends. Despite her confidence, her wide eyes reveal her youthful naivety.\n  - *Attire:* Lý Nhi often wears trendy, youthful attire that reflects her ambition—bright colors and stylish cuts that embody her desire to stand out and succeed in a male-dominated environment.\n  - *Visual Traits:* A noticeable bracelet given by Tống Nguyệt symbolizes her initial acceptance by the family, which ultimately highlights her fall from grace when the betrayal is revealed.\n\n### Mood & Tone:\n- **Visual Mood:** The story oscillates between moments of vibrancy and muted tones, paralleling the emotional journeys of the characters. Corporate settings are portrayed with stark, cold lighting, representing the pressure and isolation within the professional world. In contrast, scenes of familial interactions and street environments are warm, reflecting complexity and human connection.\n- **Camera Techniques:** Close-ups capture the characters' emotional states, particularly Tống Nguyệt's determination, Trình Khải’s fear, and Lý Nhi’s vulnerability. Wide shots in negotiation scenes highlight power dynamics, while even light and shadow play a role in depicting the tension and underlying themes of betrayal and resilience.\n- **Color Palette:** The color palette shifts from dark blues and grays in corporate settings to warm yellows and greens in familial or public spaces, reinforcing the dichotomy between personal life and work life.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\"The Betrayal Chronicles\" is visually composed to reflect a modern Vietnamese society where the pressures of career and motherhood intersect. The characters are meticulously designed to embody their struggles and aspirations, with their environments reflecting their internal turmoil and societal expectations. The storyboard will effectively capture their emotional arcs, showcasing the complex interplay of power, betrayal, and the pursuit of autonomy in a captivating, thought-provoking narrative.",

        "illustration": "### Static Scene Description:\n\n**Title: “Twilight Tension”**\n\n**Background:**\nThe illustration nestles within a suburban setting at twilight, where the sky transitions from hues of orange and purple to deepening indigo. The modest home is positioned on the right side, its weathered wood siding subtly reflecting the fading daylight. A rickety porch wraps around the front door, where a single, flickering bulb overhead casts an unsettling light, illuminating the shadows that stretch towards the viewer, enhancing the tense atmosphere. Overgrown shrubs and a crooked fence frame the scene, whispering of neglect and creating a stark contrast with the characters' polished appearances.\n\n**Characters:**\n- **Tống Duy:** Occupying the foreground, she stands strong and defiant, embodying a sense of resilience amidst vulnerability. Her long, dark hair is swept dramatically by the evening breeze, adding a wild element to her poised demeanor. She wears a simple, elegant dress in a muted shade, perhaps deep blue or burgundy, that flows gently around her knees. The fabric shimmers slightly as it catches the last rays of light. Her expression captures disbelief and simmering anger; wide eyes are lit with unshed tears while her lips tremble, forming a tight line. Clenched fists rest on her hips, showcasing her determination against the emotional storm brewing inside.\n\n- **Trình Hà:** Opposite her stands Trình Hà, a picture of aloof arrogance. He is clad in a sharply tailored charcoal suit that conveys success and confidence. Every sharp line of his attire mirrors the coldness of his expression; a smug smile plays on his lips, revealing his disregard for Tống Duy's emotional turmoil. He stands nonchalantly, one hand casually rested in a trouser pocket, while the other cradles Lý Như's arm possessively.\n\n- **Lý Như:** Beside Trình Hà, Lý Như brings a contrasting energy to the tableau. She stands elegantly, visibly pregnant, her flowing dress in soft pastel colors that highlight the curve of her baby bump. Her demeanor radiates confidence, and her taunting smile directed at Tống Duy suggests a feeling of superiority. Long, wavy hair cascades over her shoulders, and the gentle way she holds herself adds a layer of complexity to the dynamic—female solidarity versus competition.\n\n**Emotional Tone:**\nThe scene buzzes with unspoken words, as the tension is almost palpable. The long shadows extending towards Tống Duy suggest encroaching doubt and betrayal, while the warm flicker of the porch light symbolizes flickering hope and unresolved issues hanging in the air. The juxtaposition of Tống Duy’s clenching fists of hurt and resolve against Trình Hà's cold smirk heightens the emotional stakes, inviting the viewer to delve into the intricacies of their entangled lives. The colors of the twilight sky become a symbolic canvas of the inner turmoil that exists between betrayal, defiance, and the weight of choices made. \n\nThis vivid tableau invites viewers to witness a pivotal moment in an intricate web of complicated relationships, encapsulating the raw emotions and deep-seated tension simmering just beneath the surface.",

        "illustration": "**Static Storyboard Scene Description:**\n\n**Title:** Moment of Reckoning\n\n**Background:**  \nThe scene is set in a dimly lit hallway of a modest apartment, with worn wooden floors and faded wallpaper that suggests years of history. The modest decor includes a few scattered photos framed on the walls, hinting at cherished memories that now weigh heavily in the air. A single window draped with a sheer curtain allows soft moonlight to filter in, bathing the scene with a silvery glow. This gentle luminosity contrasts sharply with the shadows that shroud the young man on the floor, amplifying the feelings of isolation and despair.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n1. **Trình Hà:**  \n   - He is the focal point of the scene, kneeling on a worn, plush carpet that has seen better days. His disheveled, dark hair appears unkempt, and tears glisten on his cheeks, reflecting the moonlight and underscoring his emotional turmoil. His eyes are wide with a mixture of desperation and regret, trained on the ground below him as if unable to bear the weight of his gaze. \n   - In his trembling hands, he clutches a small silver keychain shaped like a heart, its surface catching the moonlight in a way that makes it look almost ethereal. This keychain symbolizes his lost love and past regrets, serving as a poignant reminder of what was once held dear.\n\n2. **Lý Như:**  \n   - Positioned in the doorway behind Trình Hà, she emerges as a figure of strength and empowerment. The warm light from within the room frames her silhouette, casting a gentle halo effect around her. This contrast with the cold moonlight emphasizes her role as a source of warmth and resolve.\n   - She stands with her arms crossed defiantly, her posture exuding confidence. Her expression is one of resolute indifference, showcasing a new-found strength as she observes Trình Hà's vulnerability. Dressed in casual attire that hints at simplicity and independence, her demeanor encapsulates the profound emotional shift from attachment to liberation.\n\n**Mood:**  \nThe entire scene is steeped in a quiet yet palpable tension. The soft glow of moonlight juxtaposed with the shadows creates an atmosphere of somber reflection. The stillness is heavy, punctuated only by the distant sound of sirens, suggesting a world outside this intimate moment that continues to move, contrasting sharply with the emotional stagnation within the hallway. \n\nThis visual narrative powerfully embodies the emotional conflict of longing, regret, and empowerment. It captures the poignant juxtaposition of Trình Hà's despair against Lý Như's strength, illustrating a moment where the weight of the past collides with the liberating breath of newfound freedom. The tender yet fraught atmosphere invites the viewer to contemplate the complexities of love, loss, and moving on.",

        "illustration": "**Storyboard Scene Description:**\n\n**Scene Title:** \"Fleeting Glamour\"\n\n**Setting:** A luxurious and upscale nightclub, dimly lit, creating an intimate yet suffocating atmosphere. The plush decor is characterized by deep crimson and muted gold tones, with dark velvet drapes framing the windows, allowing only glimpses of the cityscape outside. The air is thick with smoke, swirling in soft eddies illuminated by the gentle, undulating lights that bounce off the polished surfaces of the bar and tables.\n\n**Foreground:**\n- **Lý Như:** She stands as a central figure, radiant yet poignant, in her stunning shimmering red gown that catches the scant light like a beacon. The gown's form-fitting silhouette flows gracefully to the floor, contrasting her delicate posture. Her meticulously styled hair cascades in soft waves, framing her flawless face. However, her expression conveys a complex blend of resignation and wistfulness, eyes glossed with unexpressed dreams, reflecting the duality of her existence—glamorous yet trapped. The spotlight enhances her beauty, but the shadows pooling around her symbolize her loneliness and the weight of fleeting success. \n\n- **The Discarded Red Envelope:** At Lý Như's feet lies a slightly crumpled red envelope, a traditional symbol of prosperity, now abandoned—a stark emblem of her diminishing worth and unseen struggles. Its vibrant color pops against the dark floor, drawing attention to her vulnerability amidst the celebration around her.\n\n**Middle Ground:**\n- **The Bar:** To her right, an ornate bar brimming with premium bottles glimmers temptingly under the muted lights. Craftsmen have pedestaled the alcohol in indulgent displays, but the affluent patrons, clad in elegant attire and deep laughter, evoke a sense of oblivion to Lý Như's silent turmoil. Their faces are bright and animated, emphasizing Lý Như’s solitude in the crowd.\n\n**Background:**\n- **Silhouettes of Younger Women:** A group of younger women, vibrant and glamorous, can be seen in the backdrop, their figures blurred yet exuding youth and vivacity. Their laughter resonates faintly, casting Lý Như's beauty in a sharp contrast—a swirling reminder of fleeting youth and beauty, harbingers of the transience she feels in this very moment.\n\n- **Trình Hà’s Reflection:** To the left, a cracked mirror captures an abstract distortion of Trình Hà. His shadowed visage is tinged with melancholy and introspection, reflecting on choices that have led him to drift away from his dreams. This haunting image serves as a visual metaphor for loss and longing, echoing Lý Như's own sense of entrapment and bittersweet nostalgia.\n\n**Lighting and Atmosphere:**\n- Above the scene, an opulent chandelier dangles precariously, its golden light flickering like candle flames amidst a gentle breeze. It casts warm glows and assorted shadows, imbuing the nightclub with an ethereal quality while simultaneously hinting at the fragility of dreams. The light accentuates both the glamour of the setting and the darkness of Lý Như’s isolation, merging ambition with despair.\n\n**Mood:** The overall atmosphere is heavy, emphasizing themes of entrapment, fleeting joy, and the bittersweet nature of aspiration. The dynamic contrast of glamour and shadow captures a poignant moment—where the dreams of a life cluttered with choices flash like fragile luminescence against an encroaching darkness. \n\nThis scene embodies a visual narrative that elicits empathy and introspection, capturing the essence of transience and the complex emotions tethered to beauty and ambition in isolation.",
