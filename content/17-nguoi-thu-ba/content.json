    "content": "\nHôm nay là kỷ niệm ngày cưới của tôi và Giang Tùy Châu. Tôi rất vui. Chúng tôi\ngác công việc lại, dành thời gian cho nhau.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu đặt nhà hàng, mua hoa, còn tặng quà cho tôi.\n\nSau bữa tối, anh hỏi tôi có muốn đi đâu, làm gì không, mọi thứ đều theo ý tôi.\n\nTôi nói: “Về nhà thôi!”\n\nVề xem phim, tâm sự, tôi thích hai người yên lặng bên nhau hơn sự ồn áo náo\nnhiệt bên ngoài.\n\nTôi ở trong bếp cắt trái cây xếp lên dĩa, anh ở phòng khách khui rượu vang.\n\nTôi loáng thoáng nghe hình như anh đang nói chuyện điện thoại. Hình như có\nchuyện gì đó, giọng anh trầm thấp.\n\n“Sao vậy?” Khi tôi rửa tay đi ra thì anh đã thay áo sơ mi, đang cài nút.\n\n“Ôn Húc lại cãi nhau với Diệp Tiểu Noãn, anh đi xem sao. Em gọi điện cho Diệp\nTiểu Noãn hỏi xem cô ấy ở đâu.”\n\nLời này làm động tác lau tay của tôi ngưng lại.\n\nTôi ngẩng lên, thật lâu không lên tiếng, im lặng nhìn Giang Tùy Châu.\n\nĐến khi anh cầm áo khoác lên, tôi đột ngột lên tiếng: “Có phải anh thích Diệp\nTiểu Noãn không?”\n\nTôi muốn hỏi, có phải anh thích Diệp Tiểu Noãn không, hay là anh thích Ôn Húc.\n\nTôi không hiểu, rốt cuộc là Ôn Húc và Diệp Tiểu Noãn đang yêu nhau hay là Ôn\nHúc, Diệp Tiểu Noãn, Giang Tùy Châu ba người đang yêu nhau. Tại sao mỗi lần họ\ncãi nhau đều cần phải có Giang Tùy Châu tham dự?\n\nĐây đã là lần thứ ba trong nửa tháng này.\n\nLửa giận tôi bốc lên, có những lời muốn bộc phát. Nhưng ánh mắt của Giang Tùy\nChâu khiến tôi nghẹn lại.\n\nAnh dừng tay, quay đầu lại nhìn tôi. Ánh mắt cực kỳ lạnh lẽo khiến tôi cảm giác\nnhư bị hắt chậu nước đá lên mặt.\n\nAnh ném áo khoác xuống sô pha. “Em không muốn anh đi thì cứ việc nói thẳng, đừng\nnói chuyện kiểu như vậy. Nếu để người khác nghe thấy thì chuyện giữa Diệp Tiểu\nNoãn và Ôn Húc càng khó khăn hơn.”\n\nNói xong anh cầm thuốc lá ra ban công.\n\nTôi cứng đờ người tại chỗ.\n\nSau khi lấy lại tinh thần, tôi thấy tủi thân.\n\nAnh thực hiện theo ý tôi không rời đi nhưng điều này không khiến tôi dễ chịu hơn\nmà ngược lại còn làm tôi buồn thêm.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nÔn Húc là bạn từ thuở nhỏ của Giang Tùy Châu. Diệp Tiểu Noãn là trợ lý thiết kế\ntrong công ty tôi.\n\nHai người họ bắt đầu yêu nhau cách đây một năm rưỡi.\n\nBa tháng đầu, hai người gắn bó keo sơn. Sau đó tuy có mâu thuẫn nhưng không ảnh\nhưởng nhiều.\n\nĐến khi nhà họ Ôn bắt đầu phản đối. Đến khi lòng tự trọng của Diệp Tiểu Noãn bị\nchà đạp.\n\nCứ vậy, hai người biến thành oan gia, chia tay không được mà bên nhau cũng không\nxong. Mỗi lần cãi nhau không phải Ôn Húc quay lưng bỏ đi thì là Diệp Tiểu Noãn\nxóa, chặn số rồi chơi trò mất tích.\n\nÔn Húc không bỏ thể diện để cầu hòa được nhưng lại lo cho Diệp Tiểu Noãn. Vì thế\nnhờ Giang Tùy Châu tìm Diệp Tiểu Noãn giùm.\n\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn tủi thân lại đầy tâm sự, không muốn cúi đầu nói rõ với Ôn Húc. Vì\nvậy thông qua Giang Tùy Châu thuật lại.\n\nMột lần, hai lần, ba lần…\n\nRốt cuộc ai là người ăn tủy biết vị, tôi không biết.\n\nTôi chỉ biết, trong nhà tôi thường xuyên nghe thấy: “Ôn Húc và Diệp Tiểu Noãn\nlại cãi nhau!”\n\nThế nên đến mức tôi ngủ cũng mơ thấy tiếng nói này.\n\nTôi không biết mình ngủ từ lúc nào.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu không về phòng. Tôi nghĩ anh ngủ bên phòng làm việc hoặc ở phòng\nngủ phụ.\n\nTôi thức giấc xuống lầu uống nước. Chiếc áo khoác vốn để trên sô pha không còn.\n\nTim hẫng đi, tôi cứng người tại chỗ. Gần như không cần nghĩ tôi cũng biết Giang\nTùy Châu đi đâu.\n\nNhưng tôi vẫn điện thoại cho anh.\n\nMấy giây chờ đợi, một giọng nữ nhẹ nhàng vang lên: “Alo, Hứa tổng?”\n\nTôi cắn chặt khớp hàm, nhắm mắt lại.\n\nKhi mở mắt ra, tôi lạnh lùng hỏi: “Giang Tùy Châu đâu?”\n\n“Em đau bụng, anh Giang đang nấu trà gừng đường đỏ giúp em.”\n\nNgữ điệu nói chuyện của Diệp Tiểu Noãn rất chậm, giọng cũng rất nhỏ, mang theo\nâm mũi nhưng tôi lại như bị ai đánh mạnh vào đầu, màng nhĩ rung lên.\n\n“Hứa tổng, xin lỗi lại gây phiền phức cho hai người. Em biết…”\n\n“Cô không biết!” Diệp Tiểu Noãn còn đang nói, tôi lại không đủ kiên nhẫn để\nnghe.\n\nTôi cười lạnh lùng: “Diệp Tiểu Noãn, không có người thứ ba tham dự thì tình yêu\nhai người không tiếp tục nổi nữa sao? Bất kể là sếp cô hay là vợ Giang Tùy Châu,\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn, cô đang làm phiền tôi!”\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThật ra ban đầu là Diệp Tiểu Noãn làm phiền Giang Tùy Châu.\n\nLần đầu tiên cô ta gọi điện thoại cho Giang Tùy Châu là để hỏi Ôn Húc có ở bên\ncạnh Giang Tùy Châu không.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu đáp: “Không có.”\n\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn im lặng một lúc. “Vậy… anh Giang biết anh ấy ở đâu không?”\n\n“Không biết.”\n\nGiang Tùy Châu nghiêm nghị, thậm chí có phần lạnh nhạt.\n\nSau đó Ôn Húc trách Giang Tùy Châu không yểm trợ cho anh ta. Giang Tùy Châu liếc\nmắt nhìn.\n\n“Đây là lần đầu tiên cũng là lần cuối cùng, sau này đừng lấy những chuyện nhàm\nchán này đến làm phiền tôi!”\n\nLời này nói được nhưng không hoàn toàn làm được.\n\nSau này Diệp Tiểu Noãn vẫn gọi Giang Tùy Châu. Lần nào cũng vì hỏi Ôn Húc đang ở\nđâu.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu vẫn nghe máy vì Ôn Húc năn nỉ anh: “Cậu xem như dỗ trẻ con đi,\nứng phó cô ấy mấy câu. Cô ấy không có cảm giác an toàn.”\n\nCó một thời gian mà Giang Tùy Châu nghe tiếng điện thoại là đen mặt khó chịu.\nTôi còn thấy khá thú vị.\n\nTôi an ủi anh: “Con nít yêu đương thì vậy mà.”\n\nMọi thứ bắt đầu thay đổi từ lúc nào?\n\nĐại khái là từ lúc nhà họ Ôn phản đối tình cảm của hai người kia.\n\nNgày hôm đó ầm ĩ rất khó coi. Ôn Húc điện thoại cho Giang Tùy Châu nhờ anh đến\nÔn gia đưa Diệp Tiểu Noãn đi.\n\nTôi đi cùng Giang Tùy Châu.\n\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn ngồi trong xe khóc thật lâu. Giang Tùy Châu ở ngoài xe hút rất\nnhiều thuốc.\n\nSau này, thái độ Giang Tùy Châu đối đãi với Diệp Tiểu Noãn trở nên ôn hòa.\n\nTôi phát hiện điều đó thông qua một cuộc điện thoại.\n\nHôm ấy trước khi Giang Tùy Châu về nhà đã gọi điện thoại cho tôi hỏi có muốn ăn\ngì không. Tôi nói không. Sau rồi chợt nhớ muốn ăn bánh kem nên gọi điện thoại\nlại cho anh.\n\nĐiện thoại báo bận.\n\n10 phút sau tôi gọi lại, vẫn còn bận.\n\nĐến khi anh về đến nhà điện thoại vẫn còn kẹp bên tai.\n\nHơn 15 phút sau anh mới cúp điện thoại.\n\nTôi hỏi anh là ai. Anh nói: “Diệp Tiểu Noãn cãi nhau với Ôn Húc, khóc suốt!”\n\nTôi ngẩn ra, hơi bất ngờ. Giang Tùy Châu không phải là người kiên nhẫn, thế\nnhưng hôm nay anh lại nghe Diệp Tiểu Noãn tố khổ gần một tiếng đồng hồ.\n\n“Sao cô ta lại nói với anh?”\n\n“Chắc hy vọng anh đồng cảm, sau đó dạy dỗ Ôn Húc.”\n\nVì những lời này mà có một thời gian rất dài sau đó tôi không để ý họ thường\nxuyên liên lạc.\n\nMà sau thời gian đó, hai người càng có vẻ thân hơn.\n\n“Sao cô ta lại uống ly rượu của anh?”\n\n“Anh đã nói cô ấy nhiều lần rồi, y như con nít vậy.”\n\nTôi nhớ vẻ mặt Giang Tùy Châu khi nói, anh lắc đầu thở dài, nửa bất lực nửa buồn\ncười, mặt mày giãn ra, khóe miệng cong lên. Giống như… giống như một người cha\nnói về đứa con được cưng chiều hết mực của mình.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\nMột tiếng rưỡi sau Giang Tùy Châu về nhà.\n\nNếu anh đến nhà Diệp Tiểu Noãn thì từ đó về đây không quá 40 phút, thế mà anh\ncần một tiếng rưỡi.\n\nTôi không muốn đoán chuyện gì diễn ra từ lúc tôi cúp máy đến khi anh rời đi về\nnhà. Tôi chọn cách hỏi thẳng.\n\nVẻ mỏi mệt của Giang Tùy Châu có thể nhìn thấy bằng mắt thường. Anh ngồi trên sô\npha, khom lưng, tay chống lên chân.\n\nAnh nói: “Em không nên gọi cuộc điện thoại đó!”\n\nCâu này như bậc lửa đốt kíp nổ. Tôi bùng nổ ngay lập tức.\n\n“Giang Tùy Châu, anh muốn nói với tôi việc nên hay không nên sao? Rõ ràng anh\nđồng ý với tôi không đi mà lại lén đi ra ngoài, anh nên vậy? Nửa đêm trai đơn\ngái chiếc, anh nên vậy? Đường đỏ trà gừng? Anh mất thời gian bao lâu mới nấu\nxong? Anh nên vậy? Vì một người khác phái khác, anh năm lần bảy lượt tổn thương\ncảm xúc của tôi, anh nên vậy? Hừ, anh nên vậy! Tôi thấy anh nên nhất là nên độc\nthân!”\n\nMắt tôi đỏ hoe vì tức giận, nhãn cầu như vỡ ra, sưng lên đau đớn. Toàn thân căng\ncứng đến run rẩy. Ngay cả giọng nói cũng nghẹn ngào không thể khống chế.\n\nKhông mất bình tĩnh đến khóc lóc thảm thiết là thể diện cuối cùng của tôi. Tôi\nquay người vào phòng ngủ, đóng sầm cửa lại.\n\nKhông biết qua bao lâu, trong bóng tối, Giang Tùy Châu mò mẫm bước vào.\n\nAnh nằm xuống cạnh tôi, thở dài ôm tôi.\n\n“Anh sai rồi. Đây là lần cuối cùng, anh bảo đảm không quan tâm đến việc của bọn\nhọ nữa!”\n\nTôi yên lặng nhìn về phía trước trong bóng đêm, không đáp lại, cũng không phản\nbác.\n\nTrong khoảng thời gian tôi về phòng, sau khi bùng nổ cảm xúc, tôi đã bình tĩnh\nlại.\n\nNhững việc xảy ra trong đêm nay được tôi rà soát lại từ đầu đến cuối.\n\nTôi đột nhiên phát hiện một điểm khiến tôi khó chịu ngay từ đầu.\n\n…\n\n“Có phải anh thích Diệp Tiểu Noãn không?”\n\n“Em không muốn anh đi thì cứ việc nói thẳng, đừng nói chuyện kiểu như vậy. Nếu\nđể người khác nghe thấy thì chuyện giữa Diệp Tiểu Noãn và Ôn Húc càng khó khăn.”\n\nAnh không thanh minh, không giải thích. Thậm chí anh không lo lắng việc tôi hiểu\nlầm, anh chỉ lo lời nói của tôi sẽ ảnh hưởng đến Diệp Tiểu Noãn.\n\nSuy cho cùng thì đó cũng là chuyện của Diệp Tiểu Noãn với Ôn Húc; không phải là\nchuyện của Ôn Húc với Diệp Tiểu Noãn.\n\nTrật tự thay đổi, khác nhau một trời một vực.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n“Cho nên mày nghi ngờ Giang Tùy Châu thật sự thích Diệp Tiểu Noãn? Không thể\nnào!”\n\nBạn thân tôi cảm thấy không thể tưởng tượng nổi.\n\n“Nói gì thì nói, cô ta cũng là bạn gái Ôn Húc, cho dù anh ấy có động lòng thì\nđối tượng cũng không nên là Diệp Tiểu Noãn. Anh ấy chỉ nể mặt Ôn Húc!”\n\nTôi cười khẽ thành tiếng: “Nể mặt Ôn Húc? Mày với anh ta cũng xem như bạn từ nhỏ\ntới lớn, lúc mày đau bụng anh ta sẽ nấu đường đỏ trà gừng cho mày sao?”\n\nBạn thân trợn to mắt. “Đường đỏ trà gừng? Anh ta sẽ thấy tao giống đường đỏ trà\ngừng thì có!”\n\n“Đúng vậy, tao cũng chưa từng uống!”\n\nTôi và bạn thân cùng im lặng.\n\nHồi lâu sau, cô ấy hỏi: “Mày định làm gì?”\n\nTôi xoa huyệt thái dương: “Tao cần một khoảng thời gian yên tĩnh.”\n\nTôi đi công tác một tuần.\n\nTôi không nói với Giang Tùy Châu. Trước khi lên máy bay nhắn cho anh một tin.\n\nBầu không khí giữa chúng tôi hai ngày qua rất tệ. Anh có ý định phá băng, chủ\nđộng nói chuyện với tôi. Nhưng Giang Tùy Châu không phải là người khom lưng cúi\nđầu với người khác. Sau khi tôi không phản ứng với anh, anh cũng im lặng.\n\nMấy ngày đi công tác, tôi suy nghĩ rất nhiều.\n\nKhi tôi tách mình khỏi môi trường đó, dường như tôi có thể nhìn nhận mọi việc rõ\nràng hơn.\n\nThật ra tôi đã để ý sự tiếp xúc giữa Giang Tùy Châu với Diệp Tiểu Noãn từ lâu.\nNhưng tôi không nói gì, cứ nhẫn nhịn chịu đựng.\n\nBởi vì Diệp Tiểu Noãn là bạn gái Ôn Húc.\n\nBởi vì suy đoán về Giang Tùy Châu với Diệp Tiểu Noãn là chuyện hết sức hoang\nđường.\n\nNhưng nếu bỏ qua mối quan hệ giữa chúng tôi và Ôn Húc thì mối liên hệ giữa Giang\nTùy Châu và Diệp Tiểu Noãn quả thực quá thân thiết.\n\nTôi nhớ một tuần trước. Không biết vì chuyện gì mà Ôn Húc và Diệp Tiểu Noãn lại\ncãi nhau.\n\nÔn Húc sầm mặt quay lưng lái xe bỏ đi, ném Diệp Tiểu Noãn ở lại đó.\n\nSau đó Ôn Húc điện thoại cho Giang Tùy Châu, nhờ anh đưa Diệp Tiểu Noãn về nhà.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu nghe xong im lặng rất lâu, tặng anh ta mấy chữ: “Đồ khốn kiếp.”\n\nAnh vội vàng lấy chìa khóa xe ra cửa, sốt ruột đến mức thậm chí không thèm chào\ntôi.\n\nĐêm đó anh không về. Mãi đến hừng đông mới quay lại.\n\nTôi hỏi anh làm gì mất nhiều thời gian đến thế. Anh nói tâm trạng Diệp Tiểu Noãn\nkhông tốt, không muốn về nhà nên anh chơi bi da với cô ta suốt đêm.\n\n“Cô ấy có nói anh cứ về trước nhưng nửa đêm, cô ấy là con gái có một mình. Ôn\nHúc giao cô ấy cho anh, anh không thể bỏ mặc.”\n\nMọi thứ đều hợp tình hợp lý, chỉ có tôi nghĩ ngợi linh tinh.\n\nNhưng đứng bên ngoài nhìn vào thì điều đó không đúng. Chỉ là chưa sai đến mức\nrung trời lở đất.\n\nCho nên tôi cần phải chịu đựng sao? Vì sao?\n\n\n----------\n\n\nGiang Tùy Châu xích mích với Ôn Húc. Đây là tin tôi nhận được vào ngày thứ tư\ncủa chuyến công tác.\n\nBạn thân gửi một video cho tôi.\n\nTrong video, Giang Tùy Châu dùng áo khoác che chở Diệp Tiểu Noãn, ôm cô ta vào\nlòng.\n\nÔn Húc sắc mặt lạnh lùng đuổi theo. “Đứng lại, cô ấy là bạn gái tôi.”\n\nVẻ mặt Giang Tùy Châu lạnh nhạt, ngoái đầu nhìn lại đầy châm chọc.\n\n“Ôn Húc, nếu cậu không quản được gia đình mình, không thể bảo vệ được cô ấy thì\ntôi phải đưa cô ấy đi!”\n\nNghe nói chị của Ôn Húc cầm chi phiếu và offer một công ty nước ngoài nổi tiếng\nđến tìm Diệp Tiểu Noãn, yêu cầu cô ta rời đi.\n\n“Mày cũng biết lực sát thương của Tiểu Ôn tổng chúng ta mà, chị ấy nói thẳng với\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn, cô ta không thể gả vào Ôn gia. Thay vì lãng phí thời gian đẹp\nnhất của mình trên một người đàn ông, không bằng đảm bảo tương lai tốt đẹp cho\nbản thân.”\n\nTiểu Ôn tổng nhà họ Ôn, sấm rền gió cuốn, sát phạt quyết đoán. Chị ấy lớn hơn\nchúng tôi mấy tuổi, luôn là tấm gương cho chúng tôi noi theo. Chị ấy có thể nói\nnhững lời như vậy cũng không có gì ngạc nhiên.\n\nMới mười phút trước, tôi nhận được tin nhắn của chị, chỉ một câu. [Quản lý tốt\nGiang Tùy Châu, hoặc chị quản thay em.]\n\nTôi gõ nhẹ lên bàn.\n\nTôi nhớ ban đầu khi bố mẹ Ôn kịch liệt phản đối, Tiểu Ôn tổng vẫn không nói một\nlời. Chị không hứng thú quan tâm những chuyện tình cảm yêu đương này.\n\nHiện giờ chị ấy lại ra mặt, chắc chắn là đã xảy ra chuyện gì đó.\n\nVì vậy tôi gọi điện cho bộ phận thiết kế hỏi thăm tình hình công việc gần đây\ncủa Diệp Tiểu Noãn.\n\n“Cô ấy không đi làm một tuần rồi ạ.”\n\n“Ai duyệt cho cô ta nghỉ?”\n\n“Cô ấy không xin nghỉ phép.”\n\n“Sau đó thì sao?”\n\nĐầu dây bên kia im lặng. Tôi cảm thấy huyệt thái dương mình nhảy thình thịch.\n\n“Thông báo cho cô ta, hợp đồng lao động của công ty với cô ta chấm dứt.”\n\nHợp đồng lao động có thể tự động chấm dứt khi người lao động tự ý bỏ việc trong\n3 ngày, mà cô ta bỏ bê công việc, vắng mặt suốt một tuần lại không hề ảnh hưởng.\n\nThậm chí tôi còn không biết hóa ra cô ta lại có đặc quyền như vậy ở công ty.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\nHợp đồng lao động chấm dứt vào buổi sáng, buổi chiều điện thoại Giang Tùy Châu\ngọi tới. Mở miệng là định tội.\n\n“Hứa Ương, em quá đáng rồi! Từ bao giờ thì em cũng bắt đầu ỷ thế hiếp người như\nvậu? Nếu không vui thì có thể hướng tới anh, hà tất khó xử cô ấy? Có phải trong\nmắt em, bóp c.h.ế.t cô ấy cũng dễ dàng như bóp c.h.ế.t một con kiến vậy? Hứa\nƯơng, em làm anh quá thất vọng!”\n\n…\n\n“Nói xong chưa?” Tôi lạnh lùng cắt ngang, “Anh ở đây kêu gào với tôi thì có biết\ncô ta đã bỏ việc một tuần rồi không?”\n\nGiang Tùy Châu kiềm nén lửa giận.\n\n“Anh không tin em không biết chuyện xảy ra ở nhà họ Ôn. Hứa Ương, em cũng là phụ\nnữ, không lẽ sự cảm thông tối thiểu cũng không có?”\n\nTôi gật đầu: “Ừ. Rốt cuộc tôi đã hiểu sao Diệp Tiểu Noãn dám làm vậy. Anh cho cô\nta sự tự tin đó đúng không? Khiến cô ta cảm thấy ở công ty tôi, cô ta thích thì\nđến, không thích thì đi. Xin lỗi, không chỉ cô ta không có đặc quyền như vậy, mà\nanh cũng không có quyền đó.\n\nTôi đã quyết định sa thải Diệp Tiểu Noãn rồi, nếu anh đau lòng cô ta thì ôm cô\nta về dưới cánh mình mà che chở. Cho dù anh có muốn đưa cả công ty cho cô ta tôi\ncũng không ý kiến. Nhưng Giang Tùy Châu, anh không thể là chủ tôi!”\n\n\n----------\n\n\nNgày hôm sau tôi về nước. Trưa đó tôi dẫn luật sư đến công ty Giang Tùy Châu.\n\nTrước khi gặp Giang Tùy Châu, tôi đã gặp Diệp Tiểu Noãn.\n\nCô ta mặc trang phục công sở lịch sự, tóc bới cao, trang điểm nhẹ. Cô ta được\nGiang Tùy Châu bố trí làm việc ở phòng Chủ tịch.\n\nKhóe mắt tôi lướt qua cô ta, không dừng chân.\n\nCô ta lại đột nhiên đứng dậy: “Hứa tổng! Hứa tổng, tôi muốn nói chuyện với cô!”\n\nBước chân tôi không dừng.\n\nCô ta lao tới bắt lấy cánh tay tôi, mặt đỏ bừng, mắt đầy vẻ bất bình, uất ức.\n\n“Đúng, các người là chủ, là người có tiền! Nhưng chỉ vì các người có tiền thì có\nthể làm nhục người khác sao?”\n\nXung quanh yên tĩnh, mọi người đổ dồn ánh mắt dò xét về chúng tôi.\n\nSắc mặt tôi bình thản như nước, tránh khỏi tay cô ta, vô cùng khó hiểu hỏi: “Sao\ncô lại dễ bị làm nhục thế à?”\n\n“Cô nghi ngờ tôi có quan hệ không chính đáng với anh Giang, sa thải tôi vô cớ.\nThậm chí tôi chủ động gọi cô, cô vẫn phớt lờ tôi, đó không phải là làm nhục tôi\nsao? Chẳng lẽ vì cô giàu thì có quyền không tôn trọng người khác sao?”\n\n“Được rồi, đừng nói nữa!” Giang Tùy Châu vội vàng đến nơi, anh ta đứng trước mặt\ntôi, ngăn cản tầm mắt tôi, nhẹ giọng nói: “Em đến tìm anh có chuyện gì sao?\nChúng ta vào trong nói.”\n\nThoạt nhìn như anh ta đang hạ mình với tôi nhưng tôi biết, anh ta đang bảo vệ\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn. Nhưng có kẻ lại là đồ ngốc.\n\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn xúc động, hét to phẫn nộ: “Cô Hứa, cô không nên xin lỗi tôi sao?”\n\n“Diệp Tiểu Noãn, đi làm việc đi!”\n\nGiang Tùy Châu gầm nhẹ, khiến Diệp Tiểu Noãn luôn giữ tôn nghiêm đến c.h.ế.t đỏ\ncả mắt.\n\nAnh ta muốn kéo tôi vào văn phòng. Tôi dừng lại, đẩy anh ta ra.\n\n“Cô muốn bàn đúng sai với tôi?\n\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn, tôi nhớ có lần cô cãi nhau với Ôn Húc chỉ vì Ôn Húc xách túi\ngiúp một người bạn khác phái. Cô khóc lóc làm ầm ĩ như thể hai người kia đang\nlên giường với nhau. Vậy tôi xin hỏi, nửa đêm cô với chồng tôi trai đơn gái\nchiếc, không phải ở chung một phòng với nhau thì là cùng nhau giải sầu. Cô còn\ncần anh ta nấu đường đỏ trà gừng cho cô, vậy có phải hai người nên bị nhốt vào\nlồng heo thả trôi sông không?”\n\n“Tôi không có!” Diệp Tiểu Noãn đỏ mặt, “Tôi với anh Giang trong sạch, chúng tôi\nkhông có gì cả!”\n\nTôi tặc lưỡi, “Vậy nên cùng là một việc người khác làm là thương thiên hại lý,\ncô làm thì là trong sạch? Sao cô lại tiêu chuẩn kép đến thế?”\n\n“Là anh Giang đến tìm tôi!”\n\n“Ồ!” Tôi nhìn Giang Tùy Châu, “Nghe thấy không? Mắng anh ti tiện đấy!”\n\n“Anh không có!” Mặt Giang Tùy Châu trầm xuống.\n\nAnh ta siết chặt cổ tay tôi.\n\n“Được rồi, chúng ta vào đi…”\n\n“Chát” tôi tát lên tay Giang Tùy Châu, hất tay anh ta ra, ánh mắt lạnh băng nhìn\nanh ta.\n\n“Cút sang một bên, chưa đến lúc tôi nói chuyện với anh!”\n\n“Diệp Tiểu Noãn, nếu cô cảm thấy tôi sa thải cô không đúng quy định thì cô đi\nkiện đi. Nếu cô cảm thấy tôi xúc phạm nhân phẩm cô, vậy cô cút khỏi công ty\nchồng tôi ngay. Đến tận bây giờ cô còn nhận ân huệ từ chồng người khác mà còn\ncảm thấy vợ người ta không cho cô một gương mặt tươi cười. Mặt mũi cô lớn đến\nthế sao!\n\nNgày nào cũng việc này xúc phạm cô, việc kia làm nhục cô. Vậy Giang Tùy Châu thì\nsao? Anh ta cúp máy cô, làm lơ cô, không muốn nói chuyện với cô không chỉ một\nlần, sao tôi không thấy cô ghi hận anh ta. Nếu như cô có thể mang sự kiên nhẫn,\nbao dung của mình đối với Giang Tùy Châu chuyển sang cho người nhà họ Ôn, cô và\nÔn Húc đã sớm tu thành chính quả!”\n\n\n----------\n\n\n“Hứa Ương!”\n\nGiọng Giang Tùy Châu không nặng nhưng ánh mắt nhìn tôi rất nặng nề. Bộ dạng anh\nta như muốn tính sổ với tôi, khiến tôi thấy mình dẫn theo luật sư đến đây là\nquyết định cực kỳ chính xác.\n\nVì thế tôi không cho anh ta cơ hội mở miệng, lấy thỏa thuận ly hôn ra ném tới\ntrước mặt anh ta.\n\n“Đây là phác thảo của tôi, anh xem trước, có gì không hài lòng thì nói với luật\nsư của tôi. Hôm nay chúng ta tranh thủ xác định thỏa thuận cho hoàn tất. Ngày\nmai tôi sẽ nộp đơn lên tòa. Nhưng trước đó tôi muốn chắc chắn câu trả lời anh sẽ\nđưa ra trước tòa là đồng ý ly hôn!”\n\nGiang Tùy Châu cứng người. Ánh mắt anh ta dừng trên bàn thật lâu, sau đó chuyển\nqua mặt tôi.\n\n“Em muốn ly hôn?”\n\n“Phải.”\n\n“Hứa Ương, em muốn làm ầm ĩ đến mức độ nào? Có phải nhất định giữa anh và Diệp\nTiểu Noãn thật sự phát sinh ra chuyện gì đó em mới thấy bình thường sao?”\n\nTôi bình tĩnh ngồi đối diện anh ta.\n\n“Thật kỳ lạ, chính anh biết rõ có những việc vượt quá giới hạn nhưng vẫn làm.\nAnh từng bước kiểm tra giới hạn của tôi, lại từng bước kéo điểm mấu chốt của tôi\nxuống. Tôi cho rằng bao dung với anh sẽ khiến anh tôn trọng tôi hơn, ngược lại,\nanh cảm thấy tôi cần phải bao dung anh hơn! Thì ra bất kể là người thế nào thì\nđều muốn được đằng chân lân đằng đầu.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu, anh tình nguyện quản chuyện của họ thì có thể, anh bằng lòng làm\nngười thứ ba cũng được. Không cần tranh luận đúng sai với tôi, cũng đừng lý luận\nvới tôi về tình lý. Tôi không chấp nhận!”\n\nTrước đây tôi “trong cuộc u mê, ngoài cuộc tỉnh táo”, hiện tại tôi lý trí đến\nmức tôi còn sợ chính mình.\n\nNhưng Giang Tùy Châu không đồng ý ly hôn.\n\n“Nếu em để ý sự tồn tại của Diệp Tiểu Noãn thì anh sẽ chuyển cô ấy khỏi văn\nphòng Chủ tịch, phân công lại công việc cho cô ấy. Nhưng Hứa Ương, anh thật sự\nkhông có gì với cô ấy. Tất cả sự quan tâm anh dành cho cô ấy đều vì nể mặt Ôn\nHúc, không có chút tình cảm cá nhân nào.”\n\nTôi gật đầu.\n\n“Được, tôi biết rồi. Vậy bây giờ chúng ta có thể ly hôn chưa?”\n\nGiang Tùy Châu lại sầm mặt.\n\n“Em nhất quyết phải gây rối vô cớ như vậy sao?”\n\n“Giang Tùy Châu, tôi đã nhịn!” Tôi nghiêng người về trước, kiên định nhìn anh\nta.\n\n“Anh đi tìm cô ta, tôi nhịn. Anh nói chuyện phiếm với cô ta, tôi nhịn. Anh cùng\ncô ta giải sầu, tôi nhịn. Thậm chí tôi còn có thể tiếp tục nhẫn nhịn, anh không\nđến mức thực sự phát sinh chuyện gì đó với cô ta.\n\nNhưng tôi đã ngăn cản anh một lần, vào ngày kỷ niệm ngày cưới của chúng ta. Sau\nđó anh không ngần ngại lừa dối tôi, không tiếc công đợi tôi ngủ cũng phải chạy\nđến với cô ta.\n\nTôi là thứ rẻ tiền ti tiện à? Hay vì tôi nhẫn nhịn quá nhiều lần nên anh cảm\nthấy tôi tốt tính, có thể mặc anh khi dễ?”\n\nTôi đứng lên, “Giang Tùy Châu, cuộc hôn nhân này tôi đã quyết định chấm dứt\nrồi!”\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\nNgày hôm đó, tôi và Giang Tùy Châu không đạt được sự nhận thức chung về việc ly\nhôn.\n\nViệc tôi muốn ly hôn, anh ta lại tưởng tôi vô cớ gây rối. Vì để xoa dịu cơn giận\ncủa tôi, anh ta điều chuyển Diệp Tiểu Noãn đến tầng 12.\n\nBạn thân hỏi: “Vậy là tới giờ anh ta vẫn không tin mày thực sự muốn ly hôn à?”\n\n“Không, anh ta tin!”\n\nNếu không anh ta sẽ không điều Diệp Tiểu Noãn đi. Nhưng chính vì nó xảy ra sau\nkhi tôi đệ đơn ly hôn nên nó trở nên vô nghĩa.\n\n“Nếu anh ta không đồng ý ly hôn thì mày định làm gì?”\n\n“Anh ta sẽ ly hôn!”\n\nMột hôm tôi gặp Ôn Húc.\n\nTôi vốn không định chào hỏi anh ta nhưng anh ta lại gọi tôi.\n\n“Hứa Ương, xin lỗi!”\n\nTôi quay đầu nhìn anh ta, anh ta cầm ly rượu, uể oải dựa vào ghế, tâm trạng chán\nnản khó tả.\n\nAnh ta nói: “Sau này không làm phiền hai người nữa, tôi và Diệp Tiểu Noãn chia\ntay!”\n\nTôi nhướng mày.\n\nÔn Húc cười khổ, “Lần này là thật. Chị tôi nói đúng, nếu Diệp Tiểu Noãn thực sự\nmuốn ở bên tôi, cô ấy nên chủ động tiếp xúc với gia đình tôi, hóa giải mâu\nthuẫn. Nhưng cô ấy luôn mang thành kiến, hễ người nhà tôi thể hiện ra ít cảm xúc\nlà cô ấy giống như bị sỉ nhục nặng nề.\n\nNhưng bố mẹ cô ấy cũng bắt bẻ tôi, cũng dò xét tôi. Không phải khi nào cần thì\ntôi cũng trưng mặt tươi cười làm lành, ra vẻ đáng thương sao? Sao cô ấy không\nthể? Cô ấy luôn so đo tính toán, cô ấy trả giá một phân thì tôi phải trả lại gấp\ntrăm, tôi chỉ có thể thuận theo vô điều kiện, nếu không chính là tôi đối xử tệ\nbạc với cô ấy. Chẳng lẽ chỉ vì nhà tôi giàu hơn?”\n\nTôi không đáp, chỉ yên lặng gật đầu trong lòng. Có thể Diệp Tiểu Noãn thật sự\nnghĩ vậy.\n\nCô ta yếu thế nên cô ta có lý.\n\nCô ta xem bản thân là người bị hại, cảm thấy tất cả mọi người muốn làm tổn\nthương cô ta.\n\nCô ta công kích với mọi người, thậm chí với cả Ôn Húc, cả người cô ta đầy gai\nnhọn, chỉ riêng với Giang Tùy Châu là cô ta mới lộ ra chiếc bụng mềm mại của\nmình.\n\nPhải nói là rất thần kỳ.\n\nTôi không bày tỏ bất kỳ ý kiến gì về những lời phàn nàn của Ôn Húc.\n\nNhưng khi tôi định rời đi, anh ta lại lên tiếng.\n\n“Hứa Ương, thật ra cô không cần bận tâm, Giang Tùy Châu không phải vì thích Diệp\nTiểu Noãn mới đối xử khác biệt với cô ấy.”\n\nCâu này khơi mào sự hứng thú của tôi. Tôi ngồi xuống đối diện anh ta. “Ồ, thế vì\ncái gì?”\n\n“Có lẽ cô không biết, hồi cấp 3 cậu ấy đã từng thích một cô gái…”\n\nMột học sinh nghèo được nhà họ Giang hỗ trợ mới có thể tiếp tục đi học.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu rất thích cô ấy, thi đại học vừa xong thì tỏ tình với cô ấy. Cô\nấy đồng ý.\n\nHai người ở bên nhau 3 tháng. Hai tháng nghỉ hè, một tháng vào đại học.\n\nSau đó mẹ anh ta phát hiện.\n\nMẹ anh ta nói với anh: [Hoặc con tự tách ra, hoặc mẹ sẽ giúp con cắt đứt.]\n\n“Giang Tùy Châu luôn không buông bỏ chuyện đó, cậu ta luôn nói nếu cậu ta kiên\ntrì, mạnh mẽ hơn, cậu ta với cô gái kia đã có được cái kết tốt đẹp.\n\nCậu ta nói với tôi, bảo tôi đừng dễ dàng từ bỏ, cậu ta không muốn bi kịch của\nmình lại tái diễn. Cậu ta nói nhìn thấy Diệp Tiểu Noãn sẽ nhớ đến cô gái kia.”\n\nCô gái bị anh vứt bỏ. Anh quá yếu ớt nên phải buông tay. Sau đó đi du học.\n\nTôi và anh quen nhau vào thời điểm đó.\n\nAnh sống cạnh nhà tôi, say rượu nên vào nhầm phòng. Tôi đập vỡ đầu anh, báo cảnh\nsát.\n\nLúc đầu chúng tôi không ưa nhau.\n\nNhưng vì là đồng hương, cùng ở nước ngoài. Chúng tôi vô thức gần nhau hơn.\n\nThỉnh thoảng anh mua thêm ít trái cây để trước cửa phòng tôi. Tôi nấu ăn thỉnh\nthoảng cũng nấu thêm một phần gọi anh qua ăn.\n\nSau đó tôi thật sự gặp trộm vào nhà. Tôi trốn trong tủ, run rẩy điện thoại cho\nanh.\n\nAnh bảo tôi đừng sợ, chờ anh.\n\nLần đó tôi suýt c.h.ế.t.\n\nTên trộm bóp cổ tôi, ý thức tôi đã dần mơ hồ.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu chạy đến. Anh khống chế tên trộm, ôm tôi chạy vào bệnh viện.\n\nAnh nói anh chưa từng sợ đến vậy.\n\nCứ thế chúng tôi ở bên nhau.\n\nTôi từng hỏi anh, anh có mối tình đầu không?\n\nAnh nói không.\n\n“Chúng ta là mối tình đầu của nhau?”\n\n“Phải!”\n\n\n----------\n\n\nTôi yên lặng nhìn Ôn Húc.\n\n“Anh thế này là qua sông đốt cầu. Nếu nhất quyết đổ lỗi cho Giang Tùy Châu trong\nviệc chia tay của anh với Diệp Tiểu Noãn thì cũng là do anh dẫn sói vào nhà.”\n\nMặt Ôn Húc tối sầm. “Vậy còn cô? Không phải cô luôn dung túng cậu ta sao?”\n\nĐúng, tôi không quyết đoán hơn ai, cũng không nhìn xa trông rộng hơn ai. Tôi chỉ\nlà người bình thường đã tích tụ thất vọng về tình yêu và hôn nhân.\n\nCuộc nói chuyện ngầm giữa tôi và Ôn Húc tựa hồ tôi thắng tuyệt đối. Nhưng chỉ có\nmình tôi biết, lời anh ta nói với tôi đã nhấc lên sóng to gió lớn trong lòng\ntôi.\n\nQuay về chỗ ở, Giang Tùy Châu đợi tôi ngoài cửa.\n\n“Anh đến đây làm gì?”\n\n“Đón em về nhà.”\n\nNhìn thái độ của anh ta, tôi bật cười khẽ: “Giang Tùy Châu, tại sao anh lại quan\ntâm Diệp Tiểu Noãn như vậy?”\n\nGiang Tùy Châu mím môi thành một đường thẳng. Anh ta không muốn trả lời.\n\nNhưng thái độ không nhận được câu trả lời thì không bỏ cuộc của tôi cuối cùng\nvẫn khiến anh ta mở miệng.\n\nAnh ta nói: “Anh chỉ cảm thấy hai người yêu nhau như vậy, chỉ vì cái gọi là\nkhông môn đăng hộ đối mà chia tay thì quá đáng tiếc.”\n\nTôi gật đầu.\n\nTrong ánh mắt mong đợi của Giang Tùy Châu, tôi nói.\n\n“Trước kia tôi chỉ muốn hợp – tan vui vẻ, nhưng bây giờ, Giang Tùy Châu, anh làm\ntôi ghê tởm!”\n\nGiang Tùy Châu sửng sốt. Có lẽ cả đời anh ta chưa từng nghe nói vậy.\n\nAnh nghiến chặt răng, bàn tay rũ bên người siết chặt, sắc mặt dần sầm xuống.\n\n“Hứa Ương, chúng ta phải thế này sao?”\n\nTôi im lặng hai giây.\n\n“Cô gái đó tên Chu Nặc phải không?”\n\nÁnh mắt Giang Tùy Châu chấn động, không nói nên lời.\n\n“Một Diệp Tiểu Noãn trải qua hoàn cảnh tương tự đã khiến anh mất kiểm soát đến\nmức này. Tôi không dám tưởng tượng, nếu chính chủ xuất hiện thì anh sẽ như thế\nnào. Nếu anh đã si tình như vậy, đến trêu chọc tôi làm gì? Thật kinh tởm!”\n\n\n----------\n\n\nTôi không nhắc đến việc ly hôn với Giang Tùy Châu nữa. Cho dù anh ta bị tôi nói\nđến mức phòng tuyến tan rã, tôi cũng không nhắc lại.\n\nTôi đang đợi.\n\nĐợi cuộc hôn nhân này đến lúc không thể không ly hôn.\n\nHình ảnh Giang Tùy Châu ôm Diệp Tiểu Noãn rời đi không biết bị ai tung ra ngoài.\n\nNgười đầu tiên gây khó dễ Giang Tùy Châu chính là bố mẹ anh.\n\nHọ có hai yêu cầu: thứ nhất, xin lỗi nhà họ Ôn; thứ hai, cắt đứt mọi liên hệ với\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu không chấp nhận bất cứ điều nào.\n\nVì vậy người sắp đến tuổi “tam thập nhi lập” như anh ta bị bố đánh đến đưa vào\nbệnh viện.\n\nMẹ Giang Tùy Châu gọi điện cho tôi, khóc hỏi tôi nên làm gì, bà nhờ tôi khuyên\ngiải Giang Tùy Châu, “Nó nghe lời con nhất!”\n\n“Nhưng người anh ta không muốn nhìn thấy nhất chính là con.”\n\nKhi tôi xé nát mọi thể diện, nói anh ta sai trước tất cả mọi người. Cho dù lựa\nchọn hiện giờ có sai lầm, anh ta cũng sẽ một mình đi tới cuối đường. Có lẽ đó là\ntôn nghiêm đáng buồn của anh ta.\n\nNgười thứ hai gây khó dễ cho Giang Tùy Châu chính là Ôn gia.\n\nHợp đồng Giang Tùy Châu nỗ lực đàm phán suốt nửa năm đã bị Ôn gia hủy hoại.\n\nTiểu Ôn tổng chỉ một câu: “Cậu cho rằng cậu xông vào Ôn gia tôi, can thiệp việc\nnhà Ôn gia, trước mặt mọi người ôm bạn gái Ôn Húc rời đi thì không cần phải trả\ngiá gì sao?”\n\nViệc này buộc Giang Tùy Châu phải mang bệnh quay về chủ trì đại cục. Nghe nói cổ\nđông có rất nhiều ý kiến.\n\nNghe nói quyết sách của Tiểu Ôn tổng khiến công ty anh ta tràn ngập nguy cơ.\nNghe nói anh ta đã 48 giờ không rời khỏi công ty.\n\nSau đó Diệp Tiểu Noãn liên hệ với tôi. Trong giọng cô ta là sự nhẫn nhục chịu\nđựng lẫn mạnh mẽ cố chấp.\n\n“Hứa tổng, tôi sẽ rời đi. Hy vọng cô có thể giúp anh Giang vượt qua cửa ải khó\nkhăn. Tôi không muốn anh Giang vì tôi mà bị chỉ trích, chúng tôi trong sạch. Cho\ndù cô tin hay không thì chính các người mới là kẻ xấu xa!”\n\n“Đồ ngu!”\n\nNếu không phải do cô ta không nhìn thấy thì tôi đã giơ ngón giữa lên với cô ta\nrồi.\n\nCúp điện thoại, tôi chặn số, xóa mọi liên lạc của cô ta.\n\nNghe nói cô ta cũng nói những lời tương tự với Tiểu Ôn tổng và Ôn Húc. Những lời\nnày không lưu lại bất kỳ dấu vết nào trong đầu Tiểu Ôn tổng. Nhưng lại kích\nthích đến Ôn Húc.\n\nVì vậy Tiểu Ôn tổng tịch thu điện thoại anh ta, đóng gói anh ta tống ra nước\nngoài.\n\nTuy Diệp Tiểu Noãn nói rất chân thành nhưng theo tôi biết cô ta ở Tưởng thị cũng\nkhông tốt. Cô ta nhiều lần tình cờ gặp Giang Tùy Châu, nhưng không thể lại gần\nanh ta.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu coi cô ta như không tồn tại, cho dù cô ta ngã ngay trước mặt thì\nanh ta cũng không nhìn thêm một cái.\n\n“Nhưng sao anh ta không sa thải Diệp Tiểu Noãn chứ?”\n\nBởi vì anh ta không muốn thừa nhận sai lầm của mình. Giống như một đứa trẻ bướng\nbỉnh, rõ ràng biết xé sách sẽ bị đánh nhưng vẫn muốn vừa khóc vừa xé.\n\nDiệp Tiểu Noãn chính là quyển sách bị xé kia.\n\nNgười thứ ba gây khó dễ cho Giang Tùy Châu chính là ba tôi.\n\nYêu cầu rất đơn giản.\n\n“Để hai đứa ly hôn. Sau này việc kinh doanh còn có thể hợp tác, nếu không thì\ntrở mặt. Hứa gia tôi không chứa nổi người này.”\n\nTrên bàn đàm phán, Giang Tùy Châu đứng dậy bỏ đi, mặc cho bố anh ta mắng mỏ thế\nnào cũng không quay lại.\n\nSau đó không ai liên lạc được với anh ta.\n\nMẹ anh ta lại gọi điện thoại cho tôi, vừa nài nỉ vừa oán giận.\n\n“A Ương, dù gì tình cảm các con cũng đã bao nhiêu năm, cứ phải đi đến bước này\nsao? Tùy Châu thích con, mẹ nhận ra mà, cho dù bị ép đến mức này nó vẫn không\nchịu ly hôn. Con cũng muốn bỏ đá xuống giếng sao?\n\nA Ương, coi như mẹ cầu xin con, con điện thoại cho Tùy Châu, chắc chắn nó sẽ\nnghe máy của con!”\n\nThật ra không cần. Giang Tùy Châu ở bên ngoài nhà tôi.\n\nTừ lúc tôi mở cửa sổ nhìn thấy anh ta đến bây giờ đã 3 tiếng đồng hồ. Anh ta dựa\nvào xe, hút hết điếu này đến điếu khác.\n\nAnh ta không đến gần, cũng không che giấu sự tồn tại của mình. Cứ đứng yên đó.\n\nTôi lên lầu hai, lúc kéo rèm thì anh ta ngẩng lên, đối diện tầm mắt tôi.\n\nĐến khi tôi bị đồng hồ báo thức đánh thức, ngoài cửa đã không còn bóng dáng anh\nta.\n\n10 giờ sáng, luật sư liên lạc với tôi, Giang Tùy Châu đồng ý ly hôn.\n\nĐã 27 ngày kể từ khi tôi nộp đơn lên tòa.\n\nVụ kiện ly hôn giữa tôi và Giang Tùy Châu được xét xử vào thứ tư tuần sau.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nTôi tưởng Giang Tùy Châu không đến mà cử luật sư của anh ta đến. Không ngờ anh\nta vẫn đến.\n\nAnh ta mặc vest, trông hơi ảm đạm. Anh ta gầy đi nhiều, dù gì thì cũng bệnh nặng\nmột trận.\n\nBỗng nhiên tôi nhớ tới lời bạn thân nói. Cô ấy nói Giang Tùy Châu bây giờ dường\nnhư không còn sức sống.\n\nPhiên tòa diễn ra nhanh chóng. Luật sư hai bên nêu quan điểm, tòa án hòa giải,\ncuối cùng hỏi chúng tôi có muốn ly hôn không.\n\nTôi đáp ngay không do dự.\n\nGiang Tùy Châu lại im lặng thật lâu.\n\nMãi đến khi thẩm phán hỏi lần thứ hai.\n\nAnh ta ngước mắt lên, khàn khàn đáp: “Tôi đồng ý ly hôn!”\n\nBàn tay siết chặt của tôi thả lỏng ra, thở ra một hơi dài.\n\nTại thời điểm này, quan hệ hôn nhân giữa tôi và Giang Tùy Châu chấm dứt!\n\nNgày hôm đó chúng tôi không nói một lời.\n\nTôi đợi trợ lý lái xe đến đón, anh ta đi lướt qua tôi, một ánh mắt không lưu\nlại.\n\nTôi cảm thấy khá tốt.\n\nTôi cũng cho rằng chuyện của tôi với Giang Tùy Châu cứ thế là kết thúc. Cho tới\nkhi xe anh ta đậu bên ngoài nhà tôi suốt một tuần liền.\n\nBan đầu tôi không bận tâm.\n\nNhưng anh ta không kiêng nể gì, tôi càng thấy bực bội.\n\nVì vậy hôm nay khi tôi về nhà muộn lại thấy xe anh ta, tôi gõ cửa sổ xe. Trong\nxe không có động tĩnh.\n\nTôi nhìn chằm chằm cửa sổ xe một lúc lâu, cuối cùng cửa xe mở ra.\n\n“Giang Tùy Châu, rốt cuộc thì anh muốn gì?”\n\nAnh ta cúi đầu không đáp.\n\nTôi cảm thấy như có ngọn lửa bốc cháy trong lòng. “Giang Tùy Châu, anh có thực\nsự biết mình đang làm gì không?”\n\nTôi quay lưng bỏ đi.\n\nAnh ta cuống quýt giữ chặt cổ tay tôi.\n\n“Xin lỗi!”\n\nLời xin lỗi vội vàng.\n\nAnh ta nói: “Anh không muốn quấy rầy em, chỉ là anh không ngủ được thôi!”\n\n“Vậy anh đi khám bệnh, uống thuốc! Anh luôn miệng nói không quấy rầy tôi nhưng\nanh thực sự đang làm phiền tôi. Anh cảm thấy vì tôi nên anh không ngủ được, chỉ\ncó ở bên ngoài nhà tôi thì mới ngủ được sao? Tôi nên cảm động khóc lóc thảm\nthiết nhỉ? Anh ngủ không được, anh khó chịu, anh cần phải cho tôi biết, cần ảnh\nhưởng sinh hoạt bình thường của tôi? Giang Tùy Châu, anh vẫn luôn ấu trĩ, buồn\ncười như thế.”\n\nSau ngày hôm đó, tôi không gặp lại Giang Tùy Châu.\n\nNhưng chuyện của anh ta vẫn thường truyền tới tai tôi.\n\nVí dụ như anh ta biến thành người cuồng công việc.\n\nVí dụ như anh ta uống rượu đến xuất huyết dạ dày.\n\nVí dụ như người khác chỉ châm chọc tôi đôi câu, anh ta đã đánh người đó đến mức\nnhập viện.\n\nCòn cả chuyện liên quan Diệp Tiểu Noãn.\n\nCuối cùng cô ta nghỉ việc ở công ty Giang Tùy Châu.\n\nNghe nói trước khi nghỉ việc cô ta tát Giang Tùy Châu một cái, nói rằng nếu\nkhông phải vì Giang Tùy Châu thì cô ta và Ôn Húc không đến nông nỗi này.\n\nCòn phần tôi.\n\nBạn thân không tin tôi dễ dàng buông bỏ mọi chuyện. Dù gì thì đó cũng là 7 năm.\nCho dù là một người nâng lên được hạ xuống được đến mức nào thì cũng sẽ đau khổ\nrất lâu.\n\nThật sự là vậy.\n\nTôi thường uống rượu một mình trong đêm, cũng bị mất ngủ, đôi khi nửa đêm bừng\ntỉnh với cảm giác tim đập dồn dập, không thể nào ngủ lại được.\n\nNhưng tôi không để bất kỳ ai biết.\n\nTôi là người rất sĩ diện!\n\nCho dù giây sau sẽ bật khóc, tôi cũng cố nén mà kéo rèm lại.\n\nNhưng cũng may, tình trạng này chỉ kéo dài ba tháng. Sau đó tôi bắt đầu hưởng\nthụ cuộc sống tự do tự tại một mình.\n\nThỉnh thoảng tôi còn vô tình gặp được Giang Tùy Châu, tôi sẽ gật đầu mỉm cười\nthay lời chào hỏi, không hề có cảm xúc dư thừa.\n\nCòn anh là dù vội vã cúi đầu hay ửng đỏ khóe mắt; là tuyệt vọng ngập tràn trong\nmắt hay nghẹn ngào không lên tiếng thì không liên quan gì đến tôi.\n\nChuyện giữa tôi và Giang Tùy Châu đã sang trang.\n\nCuộc đời của tôi tiếp tục tiến lên!\n\n- --Hết---",

The story unfolds in a vibrant metropolis reminiscent of major Asian cities, characterized by high-rise buildings, narrow alleyways, and bustling markets. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Landscapes:** The city is a blend of the old and the new; you'll find elegant old temples next to sleek skyscrapers, which represent the clash between tradition and modernity. The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees in spring, symbolizing renewal and hope, contrasting with the grit of urban life.\n- **Architecture:** The buildings combine traditional Asian designs with contemporary styles—sliding paper doors set within glass facades, the presence of neon lights reflecting the modern youth culture, and tea houses offering a nod to heritage.\n- **Cultural Touchpoints:** The society heavily leans on familial expectations and societal norms, creating a backdrop that heightens the emotional stakes of Hứa Tâm's journey. Festivals and community gatherings can be seen around major holidays, providing a contrast to her inner turmoil.\n\n#### Characters\n1. **Hứa Tâm (Protagonist)**\n   - **Appearance:** A woman in her mid-30s, with expressive eyes that reveal her inner conflict. She has shoulder-length, slightly wavy black hair, often worn loose to symbolize her desire for freedom.\n   - **Attire:** She wears smart yet comfortable clothing—blouses paired with tailored trousers, transitioning to more casual, vibrant outfits post-divorce, representing her journey of self-discovery.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Subtle scars—both emotional and physical—that hint at past experiences, such as a lightly freckled face that conveys vulnerability.\n\n2. **Giang Duệ Tân**\n   - **Appearance:** In his late 30s, he exudes a mix of brooding intensity and charm. He has tousled black hair and a lean build, dressed in formal, quiet hues that reflect his internal struggles.\n   - **Attire:** Sharp suits that display professionalism, which he sheds in more personal settings, rolling up his sleeves, perhaps showcasing a tattoo, symbolizing hidden depth.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Tired eyes that shine with regret and longing, emphasizing the emotional weight he carries.\n\n3. **Đỗ Ngọc Nhi**\n   - **Appearance:** Early 30s, exuding confidence and charm, with long straight hair and a polished look that easily captivates others.\n   - **Attire:** Stylish, trendy outfits that symbolize her modern and independent attitude, often in bright colors that symbolize allure.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Sharp, confident features with a mischievous glint in her eyes; she represents temptation to Giang, complicating Hứa's inner conflict.\n\n4. **Ôn Duy**\n   - **Appearance:** Mid-30s, ruggedly handsome with a warm smile and approachable demeanor.

In contrast, public settings are vibrant, filled with brightly lit storefronts and bustling crowds.\n- **Camera Angles:** Close-ups during intimate conversations to capture the emotional nuances, wide shots that showcase the urban sprawl to emphasize the isolation of the characters amidst the crowds.\n- **Color Palette:** A mix of muted colors in emotionally heavy scenes (grays and deep blues) and vibrant, warm tones during reflective moments and festivals (peach, golden yellow) symbolizing hope.\n\n#### Visual Style\nThe visual style adopts a contemporary, semi-realistic approach, aiming to reflect both the emotional depth and cultural nuances of the characters. The art should:\n\n- **Characters' Expressions:** Focus on showcasing the changing emotional landscapes of Hứa through expressive facial details—sorrow, strength, contemplation.\n- **Interiors and Exteriors:** Blend realistic city environments with elements of stylized surrealism when depicting moments of introspection or significant realization for Hứa.\n- **Symbolic Imagery:** Incorporate motifs of nature, like flowers and water, as symbols of hope and resilience, juxtaposed against the urban setting.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis master concept lays the foundation for a visually immersive storyboard that captures the emotional complexity of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh.\" It emphasizes Hứa Tâm's journey towards self-empowerment amid societal pressures and the intricacies of personal relationships.

The background showcases plush furnishings, such as a deep-cushioned sofa with soft throw pillows in muted earth tones that invite relaxation. The walls are adorned with framed photographs of shared memories, hinting at the life the characters have built together. \n\nThe centerpiece of the warm ambiance is a crackling fireplace, its gentle glow illuminating the room with dancing shadows that play across the walls.

Her expression is a complex mixture of sadness and frustration, with her large eyes shimmering in the dim light. Her hair is slightly tousled, reflecting a moment of vulnerability, and she wears a casual yet elegant dress — a soft fabric in a muted color that hugs her silhouette, contrasting with the turmoil visible on her face. Her fingers, still damp from washing dishes, hint at the mundane tasks that quietly underscore her inner conflict.\n\nAcross from her, Giang Tùy Châu is depicted with his back turned, dressed sharply in a fitted, dark-colored shirt that accentuates the contours of his athletic build. The cool light casts a shadow on one side of his face, emphasizing the tautness of his shoulders as he clasps the collar, embodying a sense of stoic energy. Though his face is not fully visible, the strong lines of his jaw and the slight tilt of his head suggest internal struggle and resolve, evoking a vulnerability masked by an outward appearance of control. A thin wisp of smoke drifts from his mouth, curling upward and thickening the air between them, symbolizing the growing distance and tension.\n\n**Mood:**\n\nThe scene captures a moment suspended in time, where the juxtaposition of their physical proximity and emotional rift speaks volumes. The golden light of the setting contrasts the somber emotions that envelop the room, emphasizing the bittersweet nature of love amidst uncertainty. The viewer can almost hear the unspoken words that hang heavily in the air, making this illustration a poignant depiction of a relationship at a crossroads, eloquently illustrating the struggle between connection and the painful acknowledgment of distance. \n\nOverall, the storyboard scene effectively blends rich details of the environment, intricate character depictions, and a profound emotional tone reflective of the master concept, inviting the audience to delve into the complexities of love and the shadows it can cast.",

The story unfolds in a vibrant metropolis reminiscent of major Asian cities, characterized by high-rise buildings, narrow alleyways, and bustling markets. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Landscapes:** The city is a blend of the old and the new; you'll find elegant old temples next to sleek skyscrapers, which represent the clash between tradition and modernity. The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees in spring, symbolizing renewal and hope, contrasting with the grit of urban life.\n- **Architecture:** The buildings combine traditional Asian designs with contemporary styles—sliding paper doors set within glass facades, the presence of neon lights reflecting the modern youth culture, and tea houses offering a nod to heritage.\n- **Cultural Touchpoints:** The society heavily leans on familial expectations and societal norms, creating a backdrop that heightens the emotional stakes of Hứa Tâm's journey. Festivals and community gatherings can be seen around major holidays, providing a contrast to her inner turmoil.\n\n#### Characters\n1. **Hứa Tâm (Protagonist)**\n   - **Appearance:** A woman in her mid-30s, with expressive eyes that reveal her inner conflict. She has shoulder-length, slightly wavy black hair, often worn loose to symbolize her desire for freedom.\n   - **Attire:** She wears smart yet comfortable clothing—blouses paired with tailored trousers, transitioning to more casual, vibrant outfits post-divorce, representing her journey of self-discovery.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Subtle scars—both emotional and physical—that hint at past experiences, such as a lightly freckled face that conveys vulnerability.\n\n2. **Giang Duệ Tân**\n   - **Appearance:** In his late 30s, he exudes a mix of brooding intensity and charm. He has tousled black hair and a lean build, dressed in formal, quiet hues that reflect his internal struggles.\n   - **Attire:** Sharp suits that display professionalism, which he sheds in more personal settings, rolling up his sleeves, perhaps showcasing a tattoo, symbolizing hidden depth.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Tired eyes that shine with regret and longing, emphasizing the emotional weight he carries.\n\n3. **Đỗ Ngọc Nhi**\n   - **Appearance:** Early 30s, exuding confidence and charm, with long straight hair and a polished look that easily captivates others.\n   - **Attire:** Stylish, trendy outfits that symbolize her modern and independent attitude, often in bright colors that symbolize allure.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Sharp, confident features with a mischievous glint in her eyes; she represents temptation to Giang, complicating Hứa's inner conflict.\n\n4. **Ôn Duy**\n   - **Appearance:** Mid-30s, ruggedly handsome with a warm smile and approachable demeanor. He has an athletic build, reflecting his active lifestyle.\n   - **Attire:** Casual, comfortable clothes—denim jeans paired with fitted shirts, presenting a friendly yet grounded character.\n   - **Visual Traits:** A small, meaningful pendant he wears starts a conversation about his past with Giang, acting as a catalyst for reflection.\n\n#### Mood & Tone\nThe mood of the story fluctuates between somber introspection and hopeful renewal, captured through the following visual elements:\n\n- **Lighting:** Soft, dim lighting in home scenes to create a sense of warmth but also isolation. In contrast, public settings are vibrant, filled with brightly lit storefronts and bustling crowds.\n- **Camera Angles:** Close-ups during intimate conversations to capture the emotional nuances, wide shots that showcase the urban sprawl to emphasize the isolation of the characters amidst the crowds.\n- **Color Palette:** A mix of muted colors in emotionally heavy scenes (grays and deep blues) and vibrant, warm tones during reflective moments and festivals (peach, golden yellow) symbolizing hope.\n\n#### Visual Style\nThe visual style adopts a contemporary, semi-realistic approach, aiming to reflect both the emotional depth and cultural nuances of the characters. The art should:\n\n- **Characters' Expressions:** Focus on showcasing the changing emotional landscapes of Hứa through expressive facial details—sorrow, strength, contemplation.\n- **Interiors and Exteriors:** Blend realistic city environments with elements of stylized surrealism when depicting moments of introspection or significant realization for Hứa.\n- **Symbolic Imagery:** Incorporate motifs of nature, like flowers and water, as symbols of hope and resilience, juxtaposed against the urban setting.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis master concept lays the foundation for a visually immersive storyboard that captures the emotional complexity of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh.\" It emphasizes Hứa Tâm's journey towards self-empowerment amid societal pressures and the intricacies of personal relationships.

            "illustration": "**Static Storyboard Scene Description**:\n\nIn this poignant kitchen tableau, the atmosphere is charged with a palpable tension that holds the weight of unspoken emotions. The setting is a contemporary kitchen, designed with clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic. The dim, cool blue hue of the overhead light ensures the room feels intimate yet fraught with conflict. Shadows drape across the countertops, accentuating the furrowed brows and tense expressions of the characters.\n\n**Ôn Húc** stands to the left of the scene, his strong figure rigid against the starkness of the kitchen design. His dark hair is slightly tousled, and his sharp features are lit in such a way that the angles of his jaw become pronounced. The lines of worry etched across his forehead convey a sense of frustration, while his deep-set eyes glimmer with longing, caught between the desire to reach out to Diệp Tiểu Noãn and the fear of further rejection. His posture is defensive, a clenched fist resting on the countertop—an embodiment of the turmoil raging within him.\n\n**Diệp Tiểu Noãn**, positioned at the small dining table that sits to the right, contrasts with Ôn Húc’s intensity. She is dressed in comfortable, casual attire that resonates with her vulnerable state: a loose-fitting shirt that drapes softly over her shoulders, while a soft, worn-out sweater hangs on the back of her chair, hinting at their shared past warmth now turned to distance. Her hair falls gently around her face, framing her expression—a mix of sadness and defiance. Despite her poised posture, with her hands gripping the edge of the table, her gaze drifts out of focus, suggesting her mind is miles away, burdened by unresolved feelings of resentment.\n\nBetween them lies a steaming pot of gừng đường đỏ, the vibrant hues of the simmering ginger and sugar contrasting against the cool shades of the kitchen. The steam curling up creates a momentary warmth amidst the chill of their conversation. Surrounding the pot is a scattering of design sketches and crumpled papers on the table, emblematic of Diệp Tiểu Noãn's artistic spirit, which now seems stifled by their emotional turmoil. This motif of creativity interrupted speaks to the relationship’s complexities—once vibrant, now overshadowed by their conflict.\n\nThe window in the background reveals a darkened night beyond, framing the couple in an almost claustrophobic sense of isolation. The exterior world is unseen, symbolizing how they are entrapped in their own emotional standoff, sealed off from the reality outside. \n\nThis static scene resonates with deep emotional undertones, where the nuances of love and hurt intertwine, capturing a critical moment in their relationship where echoes of tenderness clash with the discord of current realities.

His low posture conveys exhaustion, as he leans forward with his hands resting heavily on his knees. The soft glow from a nearby bedside lamp casts warm light across his features, illuminating tired eyes that harbor regret and desperation.\n\nIn contrast, the girl beside him, her back turned, sits with her arms crossed tightly. Her silhouette is rigid against the shadows, a fortress shielding her pounding heart, while tears shimmer at the corners of her reddened eyes, reflecting the light in stark vulnerability. The golden hues of the lamp create a poignant juxtaposition against the darkness of the room, symbolizing the conflicting emotions brewing between them.\n\nOn the floor, a discarded phone lies unnoticed, its screen faintly illuminating the word “missed call”. This unassuming object encapsulates the root of their turmoil, a tangible reminder of the distance created by unspoken words and choices. A delicate bouquet of wilted flowers on the dresser signifies a love once vibrant, now struggling to bloom amidst the chaos of hurt. The air is heavy with tension, an emotional silence wrapped around them, echoing the unresolved question: \"Does he still care?\"",
            "style": "### Storyboard Master Concept for \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh\"\n\n#### World Design\nThe world of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh\" is set in a contemporary urban landscape, weaving a rich tapestry of modern life intertwined with cultural traditions. The story unfolds in a vibrant metropolis reminiscent of major Asian cities, characterized by high-rise buildings, narrow alleyways, and bustling markets. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Landscapes:** The city is a blend of the old and the new; you'll find elegant old temples next to sleek skyscrapers, which represent the clash between tradition and modernity. The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees in spring, symbolizing renewal and hope, contrasting with the grit of urban life.\n- **Architecture:** The buildings combine traditional Asian designs with contemporary styles—sliding paper doors set within glass facades, the presence of neon lights reflecting the modern youth culture, and tea houses offering a nod to heritage.\n- **Cultural Touchpoints:** The society heavily leans on familial expectations and societal norms, creating a backdrop that heightens the emotional stakes of Hứa Tâm's journey. Festivals and community gatherings can be seen around major holidays, providing a contrast to her inner turmoil.\n\n#### Characters\n1. **Hứa Tâm (Protagonist)**\n   - **Appearance:** A woman in her mid-30s, with expressive eyes that reveal her inner conflict. She has shoulder-length, slightly wavy black hair, often worn loose to symbolize her desire for freedom.\n   - **Attire:** She wears smart yet comfortable clothing—blouses paired with tailored trousers, transitioning to more casual, vibrant outfits post-divorce, representing her journey of self-discovery.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Subtle scars—both emotional and physical—that hint at past experiences, such as a lightly freckled face that conveys vulnerability.\n\n2. **Giang Duệ Tân**\n   - **Appearance:** In his late 30s, he exudes a mix of brooding intensity and charm. He has tousled black hair and a lean build, dressed in formal, quiet hues that reflect his internal struggles.\n   - **Attire:** Sharp suits that display professionalism, which he sheds in more personal settings, rolling up his sleeves, perhaps showcasing a tattoo, symbolizing hidden depth.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Tired eyes that shine with regret and longing, emphasizing the emotional weight he carries.\n\n3. **Đỗ Ngọc Nhi**\n   - **Appearance:** Early 30s, exuding confidence and charm, with long straight hair and a polished look that easily captivates others.\n   - **Attire:** Stylish, trendy outfits that symbolize her modern and independent attitude, often in bright colors that symbolize allure.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Sharp, confident features with a mischievous glint in her eyes; she represents temptation to Giang, complicating Hứa's inner conflict.\n\n4. **Ôn Duy**\n   - **Appearance:** Mid-30s, ruggedly handsome with a warm smile and approachable demeanor. He has an athletic build, reflecting his active lifestyle.\n   - **Attire:** Casual, comfortable clothes—denim jeans paired with fitted shirts, presenting a friendly yet grounded character.\n   - **Visual Traits:** A small, meaningful pendant he wears starts a conversation about his past with Giang, acting as a catalyst for reflection.\n\n#### Mood & Tone\nThe mood of the story fluctuates between somber introspection and hopeful renewal, captured through the following visual elements:\n\n- **Lighting:** Soft, dim lighting in home scenes to create a sense of warmth but also isolation. In contrast, public settings are vibrant, filled with brightly lit storefronts and bustling crowds.\n- **Camera Angles:** Close-ups during intimate conversations to capture the emotional nuances, wide shots that showcase the urban sprawl to emphasize the isolation of the characters amidst the crowds.\n- **Color Palette:** A mix of muted colors in emotionally heavy scenes (grays and deep blues) and vibrant, warm tones during reflective moments and festivals (peach, golden yellow) symbolizing hope.\n\n#### Visual Style\nThe visual style adopts a contemporary, semi-realistic approach, aiming to reflect both the emotional depth and cultural nuances of the characters. The art should:\n\n- **Characters' Expressions:** Focus on showcasing the changing emotional landscapes of Hứa through expressive facial details—sorrow, strength, contemplation.\n- **Interiors and Exteriors:** Blend realistic city environments with elements of stylized surrealism when depicting moments of introspection or significant realization for Hứa.\n- **Symbolic Imagery:** Incorporate motifs of nature, like flowers and water, as symbols of hope and resilience, juxtaposed against the urban setting.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis master concept lays the foundation for a visually immersive storyboard that captures the emotional complexity of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh.\" It emphasizes Hứa Tâm's journey towards self-empowerment amid societal pressures and the intricacies of personal relationships. Each frame will embody the tension and release found within the narrative, inviting viewers into a journey of healing, self-discovery, and ultimately, strength.",

            "illustration": "**Storyboard Scene Description: Dimly Lit Bedroom of Tension and Unresolved Emotion**\n\n**Setting:**\nThe scene is set in a small, dimly lit bedroom that conveys a palpable sense of tension. The walls are painted in muted shades of blue, enhancing the somber mood with shadows pooling in the corners. The room is furnished simply; a queen-sized bed draped in rumpled sheets, and a modest wooden dresser against one wall overwhelmed by dust and neglect. \n\nA bedside lamp with a warm, soft glow casts a golden hue over the setting, illuminating key elements while leaving parts of the room in shadow. This juxtaposition symbolizes the complexity of the emotions swirling within, creating a delicate contrast between hope and despair. \n\n**Characters:**\n\n1. **Giang Tùy Châu:**\n   - Positioned on the edge of the bed, Giang embodies a blend of weariness and desperation. His short, slightly disheveled hair falls over his forehead, and the lines on his face reveal the burden of his thoughts. He is dressed in a simple, slightly wrinkled white t-shirt and dark sweatpants that reflect his state of mind.\n   - His posture is slumped forward, shoulders heavy with exhaustion. Hands resting heavily on his knees, he stares blankly ahead, his tired brown eyes reflecting the light from the lamp, which captures the depth of his regret. His expression is one of deep contemplation, resonating with the weight of unspoken words and the emotional distance between him and the girl beside him.\n\n2. **The Girl:**\n   - She sits beside him, her back turned as a protective barrier against the emotional confrontation. Her silhouette appears slender, rigid, highlighting her defensive posture as she crosses her arms tightly against her chest. This creates a visual barrier, emphasizing her reluctance to engage.\n   - Strands of hair cascade over her shoulders, partially hiding a face marred by tears. Her skin, aglow in the bedside light, contrasts sharply with her shadowed outline, accentuating the vulnerability in her reddened eyes. A delicate, distant expression dwells on her face, teetering between heartbreak and resilience.\n\n**Foreground Details:**\n- On the floor, a discarded phone lies just out of reach, its screen faintly glowing the ominous message: “missed call”. The phone, insignificant at first glance, symbolizes the crux of their turmoil—a reminder of missed connections and the emotional distance built by silence.\n- Nearby, a small bouquet of wilted flowers sits on the dresser, their once-vibrant colors faded and struggling to stay upright. This serves as a poignant visual metaphor for the relationship that once thrived but is now in jeopardy, overshadowed by hurt and miscommunication.\n\n**Mood:**\nThe atmosphere is thick with unresolved tension, captured in the interplay of light and shadow. The warm glow from the lamp stands in stark contrast to the pervasive darkness of the room, embodying the struggle between hope and hurt. The silence feels heavy, punctuated only by the soft, barely audible sounds of their breathing—a reminder of the emotional distance that has formed. The emotional silence wraps around them, echoing the unasked question: \"Does he still care?\"\n\nThe scene is designed to evoke empathy and draw the viewer into the intricate dance of their emotions, leaving them contemplating the weight of love lost amidst unresolved conflicts.",

The story unfolds in a vibrant metropolis reminiscent of major Asian cities, characterized by high-rise buildings, narrow alleyways, and bustling markets. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Landscapes:** The city is a blend of the old and the new; you'll find elegant old temples next to sleek skyscrapers, which represent the clash between tradition and modernity. The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees in spring, symbolizing renewal and hope, contrasting with the grit of urban life.\n- **Architecture:** The buildings combine traditional Asian designs with contemporary styles—sliding paper doors set within glass facades, the presence of neon lights reflecting the modern youth culture, and tea houses offering a nod to heritage.\n- **Cultural Touchpoints:** The society heavily leans on familial expectations and societal norms, creating a backdrop that heightens the emotional stakes of Hứa Tâm's journey. Festivals and community gatherings can be seen around major holidays, providing a contrast to her inner turmoil.\n\n#### Characters\n1. **Hứa Tâm (Protagonist)**\n   - **Appearance:** A woman in her mid-30s, with expressive eyes that reveal her inner conflict. She has shoulder-length, slightly wavy black hair, often worn loose to symbolize her desire for freedom.\n   - **Attire:** She wears smart yet comfortable clothing—blouses paired with tailored trousers, transitioning to more casual, vibrant outfits post-divorce, representing her journey of self-discovery.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Subtle scars—both emotional and physical—that hint at past experiences, such as a lightly freckled face that conveys vulnerability.\n\n2. **Giang Duệ Tân**\n   - **Appearance:** In his late 30s, he exudes a mix of brooding intensity and charm. He has tousled black hair and a lean build, dressed in formal, quiet hues that reflect his internal struggles.\n   - **Attire:** Sharp suits that display professionalism, which he sheds in more personal settings, rolling up his sleeves, perhaps showcasing a tattoo, symbolizing hidden depth.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Tired eyes that shine with regret and longing, emphasizing the emotional weight he carries.\n\n3. **Đỗ Ngọc Nhi**\n   - **Appearance:** Early 30s, exuding confidence and charm, with long straight hair and a polished look that easily captivates others.\n   - **Attire:** Stylish, trendy outfits that symbolize her modern and independent attitude, often in bright colors that symbolize allure.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Sharp, confident features with a mischievous glint in her eyes; she represents temptation to Giang, complicating Hứa's inner conflict.\n\n4. **Ôn Duy**\n   - **Appearance:** Mid-30s, ruggedly handsome with a warm smile and approachable demeanor. He has an athletic build, reflecting his active lifestyle.\n   - **Attire:** Casual, comfortable clothes—denim jeans paired with fitted shirts, presenting a friendly yet grounded character.\n   - **Visual Traits:** A small, meaningful pendant he wears starts a conversation about his past with Giang, acting as a catalyst for reflection.\n\n#### Mood & Tone\nThe mood of the story fluctuates between somber introspection and hopeful renewal, captured through the following visual elements:\n\n- **Lighting:** Soft, dim lighting in home scenes to create a sense of warmth but also isolation. In contrast, public settings are vibrant, filled with brightly lit storefronts and bustling crowds.\n- **Camera Angles:** Close-ups during intimate conversations to capture the emotional nuances, wide shots that showcase the urban sprawl to emphasize the isolation of the characters amidst the crowds.\n- **Color Palette:** A mix of muted colors in emotionally heavy scenes (grays and deep blues) and vibrant, warm tones during reflective moments and festivals (peach, golden yellow) symbolizing hope.\n\n#### Visual Style\nThe visual style adopts a contemporary, semi-realistic approach, aiming to reflect both the emotional depth and cultural nuances of the characters. The art should:\n\n- **Characters' Expressions:** Focus on showcasing the changing emotional landscapes of Hứa through expressive facial details—sorrow, strength, contemplation.\n- **Interiors and Exteriors:** Blend realistic city environments with elements of stylized surrealism when depicting moments of introspection or significant realization for Hứa.\n- **Symbolic Imagery:** Incorporate motifs of nature, like flowers and water, as symbols of hope and resilience, juxtaposed against the urban setting.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis master concept lays the foundation for a visually immersive storyboard that captures the emotional complexity of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh.\" It emphasizes Hứa Tâm's journey towards self-empowerment amid societal pressures and the intricacies of personal relationships.

The gray sky looms overhead, dark and heavy, suggesting an impending rain that mirrors the emotional storms brewing between the characters. The background is filled with blurred silhouettes of passersby, their faces obscured, enhancing a sense of isolation for Giang Tùy Châu and Diệp Tiểu Noãn. The pavement glistens, hinting at recent rain, while the muted colors of the cityscape emphasize the oppressive mood.\n\n**Characters:**  \n- **Giang Tùy Châu** stands on the left, embodying strength and protection. His tall frame is clothed in a long, dark coat that wraps around Diệp Tiểu Noãn, symbolizing his desire to shield her from the chaos surrounding them. His expression is resolute yet tender as he looks down at her, the warmth of his brown eyes a stark contrast to the grayness of their environment. The coat’s fabric appears soft and inviting, suggesting an emotional intimacy amidst turmoil.\n\n- **Diệp Tiểu Noãn** is nestled within Giang’s coat, her petite figure appearing vulnerable against his strength. Her face is illuminated by the soft light breaking through the clouds, capturing a fleeting moment of uncertainty. Her large, expressive eyes dart upward, reflecting loyalty tinged with fear. The subtle quiver of her lips suggests an internal struggle, her delicate fingers gripping faded photographs that peek out from the coat. As a symbol of their past, the photographs are slightly worn, hinting at cherished memories that could soon be lost.\n\n- **Ôn Húc** stands to the right, a striking contrast to Giang and Diệp. His chiseled features are tainted with fury, his icy blue eyes glinting with determination that could cut through the gloom. Donned in a sharp tailored suit, shades of gray and deep navy create an imposing presence, emphasizing his authority and desperation. His posture is dynamic—one arm outstretched in an emphatic gesture, perhaps pleading or demanding, as he confronts Giang. The tension in his stance conveys a deeply rooted conflict, his emotions oscillating between anger and sorrow.\n\n**Emotional Elements:**  \nScattered on the ground around the trio are symbolic remnants of their shared history—delicate flower petals, once vibrant now dulled with despair, signifying lost dreams and the fragility of their relationships. The photographs in Diệp’s grasp are a poignant visual cue to their intertwined lives, frozen in moments of joy that now seem far away in the face of looming separation. The colors in the scene play a critical role; Giang's warm earth tones create a protective bubble around Diệp, while Ôn Húc's cooler tones emphasize his alienation and intensity.\n\n**Overall Mood:**  \nThe scene is charged with an atmosphere of impending change, where tension hangs palpably in the air, underscored by the heavy clouds and faint shimmer of rain on the pavement. This moment captures a critical juncture in the characters’ lives, where loyalty, fear, and emotional conflict intertwine, compelling viewers to ponder the choices that lie ahead.",

Her designer suit fits impeccably, exuding authority and confidence, while her hair is slicked back, showcasing sharp features that hint at her inner strength.\n\nOpposite her, **Diệp Tiểu Noãn** mirrors an emotional storm. Dressed in a crisp business outfit, her high bun attempts professionalism but fails to mask the redness pooling in her cheeks.

The story unfolds in a vibrant metropolis reminiscent of major Asian cities, characterized by high-rise buildings, narrow alleyways, and bustling markets. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Landscapes:** The city is a blend of the old and the new; you'll find elegant old temples next to sleek skyscrapers, which represent the clash between tradition and modernity. The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees in spring, symbolizing renewal and hope, contrasting with the grit of urban life.\n- **Architecture:** The buildings combine traditional Asian designs with contemporary styles—sliding paper doors set within glass facades, the presence of neon lights reflecting the modern youth culture, and tea houses offering a nod to heritage.\n- **Cultural Touchpoints:** The society heavily leans on familial expectations and societal norms, creating a backdrop that heightens the emotional stakes of Hứa Tâm's journey. Festivals and community gatherings can be seen around major holidays, providing a contrast to her inner turmoil.\n\n#### Characters\n1. **Hứa Tâm (Protagonist)**\n   - **Appearance:** A woman in her mid-30s, with expressive eyes that reveal her inner conflict. She has shoulder-length, slightly wavy black hair, often worn loose to symbolize her desire for freedom.\n   - **Attire:** She wears smart yet comfortable clothing—blouses paired with tailored trousers, transitioning to more casual, vibrant outfits post-divorce, representing her journey of self-discovery.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Subtle scars—both emotional and physical—that hint at past experiences, such as a lightly freckled face that conveys vulnerability.\n\n2. **Giang Duệ Tân**\n   - **Appearance:** In his late 30s, he exudes a mix of brooding intensity and charm. He has tousled black hair and a lean build, dressed in formal, quiet hues that reflect his internal struggles.\n   - **Attire:** Sharp suits that display professionalism, which he sheds in more personal settings, rolling up his sleeves, perhaps showcasing a tattoo, symbolizing hidden depth.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Tired eyes that shine with regret and longing, emphasizing the emotional weight he carries.\n\n3. **Đỗ Ngọc Nhi**\n   - **Appearance:** Early 30s, exuding confidence and charm, with long straight hair and a polished look that easily captivates others.\n   - **Attire:** Stylish, trendy outfits that symbolize her modern and independent attitude, often in bright colors that symbolize allure.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Sharp, confident features with a mischievous glint in her eyes; she represents temptation to Giang, complicating Hứa's inner conflict.\n\n4. **Ôn Duy**\n   - **Appearance:** Mid-30s, ruggedly handsome with a warm smile and approachable demeanor. He has an athletic build, reflecting his active lifestyle.\n   - **Attire:** Casual, comfortable clothes—denim jeans paired with fitted shirts, presenting a friendly yet grounded character.\n   - **Visual Traits:** A small, meaningful pendant he wears starts a conversation about his past with Giang, acting as a catalyst for reflection.\n\n#### Mood & Tone\nThe mood of the story fluctuates between somber introspection and hopeful renewal, captured through the following visual elements:\n\n- **Lighting:** Soft, dim lighting in home scenes to create a sense of warmth but also isolation. In contrast, public settings are vibrant, filled with brightly lit storefronts and bustling crowds.\n- **Camera Angles:** Close-ups during intimate conversations to capture the emotional nuances, wide shots that showcase the urban sprawl to emphasize the isolation of the characters amidst the crowds.\n- **Color Palette:** A mix of muted colors in emotionally heavy scenes (grays and deep blues) and vibrant, warm tones during reflective moments and festivals (peach, golden yellow) symbolizing hope.\n\n#### Visual Style\nThe visual style adopts a contemporary, semi-realistic approach, aiming to reflect both the emotional depth and cultural nuances of the characters. The art should:\n\n- **Characters' Expressions:** Focus on showcasing the changing emotional landscapes of Hứa through expressive facial details—sorrow, strength, contemplation.\n- **Interiors and Exteriors:** Blend realistic city environments with elements of stylized surrealism when depicting moments of introspection or significant realization for Hứa.\n- **Symbolic Imagery:** Incorporate motifs of nature, like flowers and water, as symbols of hope and resilience, juxtaposed against the urban setting.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis master concept lays the foundation for a visually immersive storyboard that captures the emotional complexity of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh.\" It emphasizes Hứa Tâm's journey towards self-empowerment amid societal pressures and the intricacies of personal relationships.

At the center, **Hứa tổng** stands with a powerful presence, her arms crossed defiantly against her body. The harsh overhead lighting highlights her sharp features—a high cheekbone structure and piercing gaze—that exude authority and determination. She dons a flawlessly tailored designer suit in deep charcoal gray, which accentuates her confidence and control, contrasting starkly with the cold architecture of the office around her. Her hair is slicked back into a tight bun, emphasizing her composed demeanor while a single stray hair escapes, symbolizing the slight crack in her otherwise perfect façade.\n\nOpposite her, **Diệp Tiểu Noãn** is a study in emotional turmoil. Her crisp white blouse and dark pencil skirt provide a professional appearance, yet they starkly contrast with the deep redness of her flushed cheeks, a clear indicator of her intense stress. Her hair is pulled into a high bun too, but strands spiral loosely, mirroring her chaotic emotional state. With her slender hands gripping Hứa tổng's arm, her desperation is palpable. Tears glisten in her eyes, threatening to spill over, as her fiery expression erupts in frustration, revealing her vulnerability and emotional struggle.\n\nOn the periphery, **Giang Tùy Châu** stands awkwardly between them, a figure of uneasy mediation. His body language conveys a mix of protectiveness and dread; his arms are slightly raised as if to shield **Diệp Tiểu Noãn** while he also aims to calm the escalating confrontation. He wears a casual suit, the looseness of his tie suggesting his discomfort amidst this high-stakes drama. His brow is furrowed, and his gaze shifts between the two women, reflecting the internal conflict of wanting to soothe both sides without taking a stand.\n\nThe backdrop portrays a sleek, contemporary office space with glass walls that amplify the cold atmosphere. Dim sunlight slices through from the expansive windows behind, casting sharp shadows across the floor—symbolic of the darkness lying within the exchange. The office furniture, minimalistic and modern, adds to the starkness of the scene while the faint silhouette of silent observers can be seen in the background, their eyes entrenched in this raw display of betrayal and pride.

The story unfolds in a vibrant metropolis reminiscent of major Asian cities, characterized by high-rise buildings, narrow alleyways, and bustling markets. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Landscapes:** The city is a blend of the old and the new; you'll find elegant old temples next to sleek skyscrapers, which represent the clash between tradition and modernity. The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees in spring, symbolizing renewal and hope, contrasting with the grit of urban life.\n- **Architecture:** The buildings combine traditional Asian designs with contemporary styles—sliding paper doors set within glass facades, the presence of neon lights reflecting the modern youth culture, and tea houses offering a nod to heritage.\n- **Cultural Touchpoints:** The society heavily leans on familial expectations and societal norms, creating a backdrop that heightens the emotional stakes of Hứa Tâm's journey. Festivals and community gatherings can be seen around major holidays, providing a contrast to her inner turmoil.\n\n#### Characters\n1. **Hứa Tâm (Protagonist)**\n   - **Appearance:** A woman in her mid-30s, with expressive eyes that reveal her inner conflict. She has shoulder-length, slightly wavy black hair, often worn loose to symbolize her desire for freedom.\n   - **Attire:** She wears smart yet comfortable clothing—blouses paired with tailored trousers, transitioning to more casual, vibrant outfits post-divorce, representing her journey of self-discovery.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Subtle scars—both emotional and physical—that hint at past experiences, such as a lightly freckled face that conveys vulnerability.\n\n2. **Giang Duệ Tân**\n   - **Appearance:** In his late 30s, he exudes a mix of brooding intensity and charm. He has tousled black hair and a lean build, dressed in formal, quiet hues that reflect his internal struggles.\n   - **Attire:** Sharp suits that display professionalism, which he sheds in more personal settings, rolling up his sleeves, perhaps showcasing a tattoo, symbolizing hidden depth.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Tired eyes that shine with regret and longing, emphasizing the emotional weight he carries.\n\n3. **Đỗ Ngọc Nhi**\n   - **Appearance:** Early 30s, exuding confidence and charm, with long straight hair and a polished look that easily captivates others.\n   - **Attire:** Stylish, trendy outfits that symbolize her modern and independent attitude, often in bright colors that symbolize allure.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Sharp, confident features with a mischievous glint in her eyes; she represents temptation to Giang, complicating Hứa's inner conflict.\n\n4. **Ôn Duy**\n   - **Appearance:** Mid-30s, ruggedly handsome with a warm smile and approachable demeanor.

In contrast, public settings are vibrant, filled with brightly lit storefronts and bustling crowds.\n- **Camera Angles:** Close-ups during intimate conversations to capture the emotional nuances, wide shots that showcase the urban sprawl to emphasize the isolation of the characters amidst the crowds.\n- **Color Palette:** A mix of muted colors in emotionally heavy scenes (grays and deep blues) and vibrant, warm tones during reflective moments and festivals (peach, golden yellow) symbolizing hope.\n\n#### Visual Style\nThe visual style adopts a contemporary, semi-realistic approach, aiming to reflect both the emotional depth and cultural nuances of the characters. The art should:\n\n- **Characters' Expressions:** Focus on showcasing the changing emotional landscapes of Hứa through expressive facial details—sorrow, strength, contemplation.\n- **Interiors and Exteriors:** Blend realistic city environments with elements of stylized surrealism when depicting moments of introspection or significant realization for Hứa.\n- **Symbolic Imagery:** Incorporate motifs of nature, like flowers and water, as symbols of hope and resilience, juxtaposed against the urban setting.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis master concept lays the foundation for a visually immersive storyboard that captures the emotional complexity of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh.\" It emphasizes Hứa Tâm's journey towards self-empowerment amid societal pressures and the intricacies of personal relationships.

The soft amber glow of flickering candles adorns small, rustic wooden tables, casting playful shadows that dance across the walls. Potted greenery — ferns and peace lilies — frame the cozy space, adding splashes of life amidst the subdued lighting. One wall features a large window that overlooks rain-soaked streets, the blurred outlines of pedestrians barely visible through the glass. Outside, the raindrops create a rhythmic patter, contributing a gentle, melancholic ambiance that complements the ongoing conversation within.\n\nThe café’s interior reflects a blend of vintage charm and modern coziness, with warm hues intertwining through the light fixtures and furniture, creating a welcoming yet introspective environment.

A faint, bittersweet smile graces his lips, hinting at an acceptance of the complexities that bind them. His soulful gaze meets Hứa Ương’s, revealing layers of unspoken words and emotional depth.\n\n#### Symbolism\nBetween them lies a small, delicate flower, its vibrant petals contrasting with the muted tone of the café.

The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees in spring, symbolizing renewal and hope, contrasting with the grit of urban life.\n- **Architecture:** The buildings combine traditional Asian designs with contemporary styles—sliding paper doors set within glass facades, the presence of neon lights reflecting the modern youth culture, and tea houses offering a nod to heritage.\n- **Cultural Touchpoints:** The society heavily leans on familial expectations and societal norms, creating a backdrop that heightens the emotional stakes of Hứa Tâm's journey. Festivals and community gatherings can be seen around major holidays, providing a contrast to her inner turmoil.\n\n#### Characters\n1. **Hứa Tâm (Protagonist)**\n   - **Appearance:** A woman in her mid-30s, with expressive eyes that reveal her inner conflict. She has shoulder-length, slightly wavy black hair, often worn loose to symbolize her desire for freedom.\n   - **Attire:** She wears smart yet comfortable clothing—blouses paired with tailored trousers, transitioning to more casual, vibrant outfits post-divorce, representing her journey of self-discovery.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Subtle scars—both emotional and physical—that hint at past experiences, such as a lightly freckled face that conveys vulnerability.\n\n2. **Giang Duệ Tân**\n   - **Appearance:** In his late 30s, he exudes a mix of brooding intensity and charm. He has tousled black hair and a lean build, dressed in formal, quiet hues that reflect his internal struggles.\n   - **Attire:** Sharp suits that display professionalism, which he sheds in more personal settings, rolling up his sleeves, perhaps showcasing a tattoo, symbolizing hidden depth.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Tired eyes that shine with regret and longing, emphasizing the emotional weight he carries.\n\n3. **Đỗ Ngọc Nhi**\n   - **Appearance:** Early 30s, exuding confidence and charm, with long straight hair and a polished look that easily captivates others.\n   - **Attire:** Stylish, trendy outfits that symbolize her modern and independent attitude, often in bright colors that symbolize allure.\n   - **Visual Traits:** Sharp, confident features with a mischievous glint in her eyes; she represents temptation to Giang, complicating Hứa's inner conflict.\n\n4. **Ôn Duy**\n   - **Appearance:** Mid-30s, ruggedly handsome with a warm smile and approachable demeanor. He has an athletic build, reflecting his active lifestyle.\n   - **Attire:** Casual, comfortable clothes—denim jeans paired with fitted shirts, presenting a friendly yet grounded character.\n   - **Visual Traits:** A small, meaningful pendant he wears starts a conversation about his past with Giang, acting as a catalyst for reflection.\n\n#### Mood & Tone\nThe mood of the story fluctuates between somber introspection and hopeful renewal, captured through the following visual elements:\n\n- **Lighting:** Soft, dim lighting in home scenes to create a sense of warmth but also isolation. In contrast, public settings are vibrant, filled with brightly lit storefronts and bustling crowds.\n- **Camera Angles:** Close-ups during intimate conversations to capture the emotional nuances, wide shots that showcase the urban sprawl to emphasize the isolation of the characters amidst the crowds.\n- **Color Palette:** A mix of muted colors in emotionally heavy scenes (grays and deep blues) and vibrant, warm tones during reflective moments and festivals (peach, golden yellow) symbolizing hope.\n\n#### Visual Style\nThe visual style adopts a contemporary, semi-realistic approach, aiming to reflect both the emotional depth and cultural nuances of the characters. The art should:\n\n- **Characters' Expressions:** Focus on showcasing the changing emotional landscapes of Hứa through expressive facial details—sorrow, strength, contemplation.\n- **Interiors and Exteriors:** Blend realistic city environments with elements of stylized surrealism when depicting moments of introspection or significant realization for Hứa.\n- **Symbolic Imagery:** Incorporate motifs of nature, like flowers and water, as symbols of hope and resilience, juxtaposed against the urban setting.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis master concept lays the foundation for a visually immersive storyboard that captures the emotional complexity of \"Tìm Lại Sức Mạnh.\" It emphasizes Hứa Tâm's journey towards self-empowerment amid societal pressures and the intricacies of personal relationships. Each frame will embody the tension and release found within the narrative, inviting viewers into a journey of healing, self-discovery, and ultimately, strength.",

            "illustration": "**Static Scene Description:**\n\nThe illustration vividly portrays a dimly lit urban scene, characterized by a striking contrast between light and shadow, encapsulating the emotional stalemate of A Ương and Giang Tùy Châu. \n\nIn the forefront, **A Ương** commands attention, standing by a large window that frames her figure. The soft, diffused light from the streetlamp outside casts a gentle glow on her tear-streaked, sorrowful face, revealing the deep inner conflict she faces. Her flowing, muted outfit – a delicate blend of grays and blues – flutters slightly in a nonexistent breeze, suggesting a yearning for freedom and the instability of her emotional state. Her gaze is fixed outwards, as if she is searching for answers or a way out, embodying both despair and quiet resolve. The window's glass is slightly fogged, further contributing to the scene's somber tone and isolating her from the world beyond.\n\nBelow, **Giang Tùy Châu** leans against his sleek, dark car, partially obscured by shadows that create an aura of mystery and stress around him. His tense posture and disheveled hair speak volumes about his internal struggle; the cigarette in his hand emits thin wisps of smoke that drift upwards, a visual manifestation of his unvoiced regrets and the weight of unfulfilled expectations. The car, polished yet cold, symbolizes his outward success, contrasting sharply with the turmoil simmering beneath his surface. \n\nSurrounding them are towering, oppressive buildings that loom in the backdrop, their silhouettes merging into the night sky. The rain-slicked pavement glistens under the faint glow of streetlights, the reflection of unclaimed promises rippling with each drop that falls, further enhancing the melancholic atmosphere. \n\nAt the forefront of their separate worlds lies a discarded wedding ring, glimmering faintly in the dim light. It rests just beyond the illuminated area, a haunting reminder of a commitment now fractured, embodying the emotional distance that has crept into their lives. \n\nThe overall color palette features cool blues and grays, with hints of warm orange emanating from the streetlights—warmth that feels profoundly out of reach amidst their despair. This emotional duality encapsulates the painful intimacy of their unresolved ties, drawing the viewer into a moment heavy with unspoken feelings and the weight of an impending decision, reflecting the core themes of love, loss, and longing that thread through the master concept.",

The overhead lighting is minimal, with most areas enveloped in shadows that seem to swallow the finer details of the room, save for the lone spotlight that starkly illuminates the presiding judge's bench. The atmosphere is thick with tension, highlighting the finality of the proceedings that are taking place.\n\n**Foreground Characters:**\n\nAt the forefront stands **Giang Tùy Châu**, his figure clad in a somber black suit that fits loosely on his gaunt frame, embodying his disheartened state. His lean build suggests a once-commanding presence, now dwindled by the weight of his current circumstances. His skin is pallid under the unforgiving glow of the spotlight, and his eyes—dull and distant—reflect a lifetime of struggles, a faint glimmer of vulnerability hinting at deeply buried emotions. His posture is slightly hunched, revealing weariness, and his hands tremble gently at his sides, showcasing his apprehension.\n\nOpposite him stands **the protagonist**, her stance strong yet tinged with sorrow. She is dressed in a simple yet elegant outfit that echoes her resilience—perhaps a fitted navy dress that contrasts with the gray surroundings. Her expression is one of resolve, yet her eyes betray flickers of past memories, haunted yet steely. Shadows cling to her features, evoking a sense of both determination and heartbreak.

An unseen draft flows through the room, whisper-like, wrapping around the edges and evoking a sense of past regrets and unfulfilled promises—a soft, haunting reminder of their ghosts. \n\nAbove them, the solitary spotlight casts sharp shadows, illuminating the emotion-laden scene: the judge watches over, an impartial figure etched in authority, while the remainder of the space is cloaked in darkness. The light serves as a metaphor for their relationship’s trajectory—once vibrant and alive, now reduced to a moment caught in silence.\n\n**Window and Mood:**\n\nThrough a large window at the back of the courtroom, the last rays of twilight spill into the scene, painting the glass with hues of warm oranges and purples. This contrasts sharply with the coldness of the setting, suggesting that within the pain of their farewell lies the potential for new beginnings. Twinkles of fading daylight seep through, hinting that endings pave the way for fresh starts, even as twilight encroaches.\n\nOverall, this static moment encapsulates the intensity of their final encounter—the culmination of love and sorrow, the clash between liberation and loss, captured beautifully in the tension-filled air of the courtroom.",
